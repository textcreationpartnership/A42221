            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <salute>Much Honoured Sir,</salute>
            <p>THE Tranſlation of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Labour of the great and famous
<hi>Grotius,</hi> may boldly Claim the Honour of being Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your
Patronage for many Cauſes. The Excellency of this Subject, being a Defence of
one of the moſt Fundamental Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, requires a
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Worth and Excellency; and ſuch a one (I may ſpeak it without
flattery) is your ſelf, who are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <pb facs="tcp:106819:3"/>for Learning, and
exemplary for Piety. Your Works that are publiſhed in the World, which are
both greatly approved for their Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and juſtly admired for their
Profundity, are an invincible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how Greatneſs and Goodneſs are
joyned together in you by a a lovely Union. But there is alſo a peculiar
Encouragement to Dedicate this Book to you, becauſe you were the firſt that
encouraged the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation and Publication of this Work. And verily, if the
ſeaſonableneſs of a thing adds to its beauty, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> hath
teſtified, this Work hath found a fit time for its Impreſſion. For at
this time, that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Hereſie of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> as the word in the
Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſignifies, that Root of Bitterneſs, the helliſh Error of
wretched and blaſphemous <hi>Socinus,</hi> who trampled <pb facs="tcp:106819:3"/>under his
Feet <hi>the Blood of Jeſus, the Mediatour of the New Covenant,</hi> is now
beginning to ſpread it ſelf in <hi>England,</hi> and to infect whole
Houſes with a worſe and more dangerous than any <hi>Egyptian</hi> Plague.
If the Son of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> who had been dumb all his days before, was
ſo wonderfully affected with the danger his Father's Life was in, that the
bands of his Tongue, through the vehemency of Natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were
diſſolved, ſo that he, that never ſpake before, ſuddainly cried out,
<hi>Kill not my Father King</hi> Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; how much more zealouſly may I,
that have been a great while lurking in Darkneſs, as thoſe that have been
long dead, now appear in the Light againſt thoſe Enemies of my Redeemer,
who by their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Blaſphemies are not aſhamed to ſpit in the Face of
my Lord Jeſus <pb facs="tcp:106819:4"/>with greater Impudence than ever did the Jews at
his Crucifixion. I am very glad that my bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath honoured me
to be Inſtrumental for the Confutation of that filthy Error of
<hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> which is as ready a way to Hell, as ever the Devil of
Hell found out, ſince he was a Devil.</p>
            <p>Methinks the very mention of the name of <hi>Socinus,</hi> may
make the heart of a gracious Chriſtian to riſe with holy Indignation, and
his hair to ſtand with amazement, that ſuch a blaſphemous Wretch could be
found upon the Earth. How did this Blaſphemer ſtrive to vilifie the Blood
of Chriſt Jeſus, as if thereby our Sins had not been expiated, as if
thereby no Satisfaction had been made to the Juſtice of the holy God, as if
the Death and Sufferings of this Lamb of God had not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <pb facs="tcp:106819:4"/>the ſins of the World, and had been no Propitiation for our ſins.
Thoſe wicked Blaſphemies are throughly Confuted, both by invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Arguments of ſound Reaſon, and evident Teſtimonies of Scripture in this
Learned Work of <hi>Grotius.</hi> God hath exhorted all Chriſtians by the

            <head>CHAP. I. The State of the Controverſy is ſhewed, and the true
Opinion is Explained in the Words of Scripture.</head>
            <p>BEfore we come to this Diſpute, we will firſt ſet down that
Opinion, which being taken out of Sacred Writings, the Church of Chriſt hath
hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106819:6"/>defended with an unwavering Faith, that afterwards
it may evidently appear, what is the difference between this and the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Socinus:</hi> Therefore we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſame Opinion, bringing
ſome Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scripture, which becauſe <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> wreſted
to another Senſe, by the way the true Interpretation of them ſhall be
vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated. Therefore the Catholick Opinion is thus: God being moved by his
own Goodneſs to be ſignally beneficial unto us, but our ſins ſtanding
in the way, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Puniſhment, he appointed that Chriſt, being
willing of his own free Love towards men, ſhould ſuffer puniſhment for
our ſins by enduring very grievous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a bloody and ignomious
Death, that without prejudice to the demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine
Righteouſneſs we ſhould, by Faith Interpoſing, be delivered from the
puniſhment of Eternal Death.</p>
            <p>The firſt Efficient Cauſe of the Thing, whereof we treat, is
God. <hi>God gave his only begotten Son, that he that believeth in him ſhould
not periſh,</hi> John 3.16. <hi>God ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his own Son, but delivered
him up for us all,</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>God laid upon Chriſt the ſins of us
all,</hi> Iſai. 53.6. <hi>God made Chriſt ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106819:6"/>The former Cauſe that moved God is Mercy, or

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Love to Mankind. <hi>So God
loved the World, that he gave his Son,</hi> John 3.16. God commends his Love to
us, that when we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us, <hi>Rom.</hi>
5.10.</p>
            <p>The other Cauſe, which moved God, is our Sins deſerving
Puniſhment. <hi>Chriſt was delivered for our ſins,</hi> Rom. 4.25. Where
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is with an Accuſative, which
amongſt the Authors of the Greek Tongue, Sacred and Profane, is a very
uſual ſign of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive Cauſe: As when it is ſaid

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>For theſe things the wrath
of God comes upon the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 5.6. And as oft as
that Phraſe, <hi>propter peccata,</hi> for Sins, is joined to Sufferings, it
admits no ſenſe different from an impulſive Cauſe: <hi>I will puniſh
you ſeven times for your ſins,</hi> Levit. 26.28. <hi>For thoſe
Abominations the Lord God caſts them out from your ſight,</hi> Deut. 18.12.
and in ſeveral other places of Scripture; neither is it any where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ways.</p>
            <p>And that other Phraſe,<hi>pro peccatis,</hi> for ſins, hath the
ſame force, as oft as it is join'd with <hi>Sufferings.</hi> Hitherto belong

have the final Cauſe, and not the impulſive to be denoted. Yea, which is
more, he adds, That by the word <hi>(pro) for,</hi> and the Greek word

be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiis gratias agere aut reddere,</hi> to give or render thanks for
benefits, as <hi>Cicero</hi> doth very often. The ſame ſaid,
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lciſei pro in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriis,</hi> 
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106819:7"/>To revenge for Injuries;
<hi>Pro mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudine ſceleris poenas perſolvere,</hi> To ſuffer
puniſhment for the greatneſs of the Crime; <hi>Supplicia pro maleficiis
metuere,</hi> To fear pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for evil Deeds. As <hi>Plautus,
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigare pro commerita noxia,</hi> To chaſtiſe for a deſerving Crime.
And <hi>Terentius; Pro dictis &amp; factis: ulciſci,</hi> To take vengeance
for Words and Deeds. In all theſe places <hi>(pro) for</hi> ſignifies not
the final Cauſe, but the impulſive. So alſo when Chriſt is ſaid,
<hi>pro peccatis paſſus aut mortuus,</hi> to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered or died for
ſins; the Matter it ſelf ſuffers not the final Cauſe to be underſtood
(as <hi>Socinus</hi> would have it;) for becauſe there is a twofold End,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The End to whom, and the End for
whom. As the End to whom the Medicine is made, is the diſeas'd Man, the End
for the ſake whereof is Health, and neither of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to ſin: For
whether you ſay with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> that it is the end of Chriſt's
Death, that we ſhould be drawn back, or removed from our ſins, or whether
alſo that we may obtain the remiſſion of ſins, (that we may omit that
this End, according to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) could not be attributed unto Death, but
very remotely) neither of them can be expreſſed by theſe words,
<hi>propter peccata,</hi> 
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106819:8"/>for ſins, or, <hi>pro
peccatis,</hi> for ſins: for the End to whom will be Man; but the End for
what, is not for ſins, but for that which is moſt contrary to ſins, the
deſtruction or remiſſion of ſins. Who ever ſaid a Drug (or Medicine)
was taken for Death, that is, to prevent Death? But it is therefore ſaid to
be taken for the Diſeaſe, becauſe the Diſeaſe drives us thitherto. It
follows, therefore, that the impulſive Cauſe ſhould be underſtood here.
Wherefore when alſo the Particle <hi>[Min]</hi> amongſt the Hebrews
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the Antecedent or impulſive Cauſe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.9. and
elſewhere often; that place of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.5. cannot be tranſlated
better and more agreeably to other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures than, <hi>Dolore afficitur ob
defectiones noſtras; atteritur ob iniquitates noſtras:</hi> he is afflicted
for our faults; he is bruiſed for our iniquities. And that <hi>Romans</hi>
6.10. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>died unto ſin,</hi>
what other thing can it ſignifie, but <hi>Mortuus est ob pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi> he
died for ſin?</p>
            <p>But the impulſive Cauſe, though it may be manifold, yet in this
place it muſt be taken for meritorious; for the Diſcourſe is of
Puniſhment, as we ſhall preſently ſhew. Now ſins are the cauſe of
puniſhment no otherways than by way of merit. Neither <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106819:8"/>can
it be ſhewed that theſe words <hi>ob pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> for ſins, or
<hi>propter peccata,</hi> for ſins, are any otherways taken in the holy
Scriptures, than in this ſignification of Merit, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they are
joined with Sufferings. That place doth not prove the contrary 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
14.16. <hi>God will deliver</hi> Iſrael <hi>for the ſins of</hi> Jeroboam:
for the ſins of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> in that place ſignifie the <hi>kind it
ſelf</hi> of the ſin, to wit, <hi>Idolatry,</hi> unto which
<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> ſtirred up the People: for the following words make that
evident; <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus peccavit, &amp; quibus peccare fecit</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elem,
which he ſinned, and which he made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin. For this is
the truer Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, than that brought by <hi>Socinus, Qui peccavit &amp;
qui peccare fecit</hi> Iſraelem, Who ſinned, and who made <hi>Iſrael</hi>
to ſin. Therefore thoſe ſins, whereof <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was the Author,
and the People the Followers, deſerved that Puniſhment of being deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up. Though I may alſo mention, that Sacred Writings do teſtify, that the
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of other mens ſins are juſtly puniſhed, not only for their
own, but alſo for other mens ſins; which is ſo evident, that
<hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> himſelf is compelled to confeſs, that a man may be
puniſhed for other mens ſins, if he is partaker of the Crime. But that 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106819:9"/>place of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.12. which <hi>Socinus</hi>
citeth, makes evidently againſt him; <hi>In increpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus propter
iniquitatem corripuiſti ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem, &amp; liquefieri feciſti ut tineam
deſideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ejus;</hi> With rebukes thou haſt corrected man for iniquity,
and haſt made his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to conſume like a Moth; that is, If thou
would'ſt puniſh a man as much as his ſin deſerves, verily that man's
life would not be worth the enjoying of it: for by this Argument he endeavours
to move God to pity. As elſewhere; <hi>If thou mark iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> (that
is, if thou ſtrictly requireſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for them) <hi>who ſhall
ſtand or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure?</hi> Pſal. 130.3. Therefore that remains unſhaken, that
the Phraſe <hi>ob peccata,</hi> for ſins, doth denote the Impulſive
Cauſe, and indeed the Meritorious: for that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> ſomewhere
ſeeks this way of eſcape, that he ſays, It is ſufficient for the truth
of this Phraſe, that any kind of occaſion be ſignified. Firſt, That is
contrary to his Poſition, in which he had ſaid that the word <hi>(pro)
for,</hi> was never referred to an Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Cauſe, but always to a Final
Cauſe, becauſe an Occaſion is no way a Final Cauſe: but if it
deſerves to be called a Cauſe, it ought to be referred to an Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
Moreover, both the Cuſtom of <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106819:9"/>Scripture and Uſual Speech,
doth clearly confute ſuch an Expoſition of the words, <hi>pro
peccatis,</hi> for ſins, and <hi>ob peccata,</hi> for ſins. Hence it may be
underſtood how errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <hi>Socinus</hi> denies, That there may be
found an Antecedent Cauſe of the Death of Chriſt, beſides the Will of God
and Chriſt. Which is manifeſtly contrary to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Paul, If
there is righteouſneſs by the Law, then Chriſt died
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, <hi>in vain,</hi> by
the acknowledgment of <hi>Socinus,</hi> ſignifies <hi>without Cauſe:</hi>
but there ſhould have been added, <hi>without an Antecedent Cauſe;</hi>
which is the original and moſt frequent ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this word. The
original of it is from the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which ſignifies a Gift, that is, ſuch a Gift as hath not an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
Cauſe of Right: whence it began to be tranſlated alſo to other things, in
which the Antecedent Cauſe is not found. So <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 25.19.
ſpeaking of his Enemies, ſays, <hi>They hated me</hi> [hinam] <hi>in
vain,</hi> that is, when I had given them no Cauſes of hatred. Which Chriſt
applying to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 15.25. ſays, <hi>They hated me
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> without a cauſe,</hi> juſt in
the ſame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The place of <hi>Paul</hi> it ſelf, of which we
are treating, ſuffers not another Cauſe <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106819:10"/>than an
Antecedent to be underſtood. For the Cauſe which <hi>Socinus</hi>
deviſeth, to wit, That they, who mend their lives, ſhould be aſſured of
the pardon of their ſins, this Final Cauſe appertains unto the Preaching,
and the Reſurrection, but not to Death: which when <hi>Socinus</hi> ſaw,
here he would have Chriſt underſtood by the name of Death, and alſo that
Preaching and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection are included; both wreſtingly and contrary
to the mind of <hi>Paul:</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> denying that Chriſt <hi>died
for all,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that there is ſome peculiar Cauſe, which
ſhould belong to the Death of Chriſt; for otherways he could have preached
for a certain Cauſe, and for a certain Cauſe have received a Reward, (for
according to <hi>Socinus</hi> the Reſurrection is only referred hither) and
not have died. Moreover, that <hi>Paul</hi> had a peculiar reſpect to the
Death of Chriſt, that which goes before makes it ſufficiently evident,
<hi>who gave himſelf for me;</hi> for that Giving every where in the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſignifies Death. And <hi>Paul</hi> calling this ſame thing
<hi>the Grace of God,</hi> denies that that is deſpiſed or rejected by him,
and immediately gives a Reaſon; <hi>For if righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs came by the
Law, Chriſt then died in vain:</hi> ſignifying by the contrary, that 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106819:10"/>this is the peculiar Cauſe, why Chriſt gave himſelf,
and died, becauſe we by the Law were not juſt, but guilty of puniſhment;
therefore our <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> iniquity is the
Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Cauſe of the Death of Chriſt. The other Efficient Cauſe is
Chriſt himſelf, and that a willing Cauſe. <hi>I lay down my life,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt; <hi>no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my
ſelf,</hi> John 10.18. <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for us, for the
Church,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Eph. 5.2. and 5.25.</p>
            <p>The Cauſe that moved Chriſt was his
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Love to Mankind. <hi>This
is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my Command, that ye love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I loved you.
Greater love than this hath no man, that a man ſhould lay down his life for
his Friends. Ye are my Friends,</hi> John 15.13. <hi>In the Faith of the Son of
God that loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>Who loved us,
and waſhed us from our ſins in his blood,</hi> Apoc. 1.5. <hi>Chriſt

loved the Church, and gave himſelf for her,</hi> Eph. 5.25.</p>
            <p>The Matter is both the Torment going before Death, and chiefly Death
it ſelf. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calleth Torments by a pathetical name
<hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burah, a Wound, Iſai.</hi> 53.5. And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. calls them
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſtripes.</hi> Therefore we
alſo <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106819:11"/>ſee mention made of the Croſs, where this
Argument is handled: <hi>He reconciled both to God by the Croſs,</hi>
Epheſ. 2.16. <hi>Having made peace by the blood of the Croſs,</hi> 1 Col.
12. Neither ſhould only thoſe Corporal pains be underſtood by the name of
Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but chiefly thoſe very grievous Sufferings of Mind, which the
Evangeliſts ſignifie by the words
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, to be ſorrowful, to be
aſtoniſhed, to be heavy: in reſpect of which chiefly Chriſt cried out,
that he was forſaken of God.</p>
            <p>The other part of the Matter, Death it ſelf, is urged in many
places: <hi>I lay down my life,</hi> John 10.18. <hi>He reconciled us by
Death,</hi> Coloſſ. 1.22. <hi>Death coming between, for the Redemption of
Tranſgreſſions,</hi> Hebr. 9.15. This Death in the holy Scriptures is
conſidered chiefly with two qualities, as Bloody, and as Ignominious. That
qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of bloody Death is denoted by the word <hi>Blood. This is the Blood of
the New Covenant, which is poured forth for many, for the remiſſion of
ſins,</hi> Matth. 26.28. Luke 22.20. <hi>God purchaſed the Church with his
own blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. <hi>God hath appointed Chriſt for a Propitiation
by Faith in his Blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. <hi>Juſtified in his Blood,</hi> 
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106819:11"/>Rom. 5.9. <hi>We have redemption by his Blood, the
remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Eph. 1.7. <hi>Ye that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were afar off,
are made near by the Blood of Chriſt, for he is our peace,</hi> Eph. 2.13.
<hi>We have redemption by his Blood,</hi> Col. 1.14. <hi>Having made peace by
the Blood of the Croſs,</hi> Col. 1.14. <hi>Not by the Blood of Bulls or
Goats, but by his own Blood he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the holy place, having obtained
eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal redemption,</hi> Hebr. 10.12. <hi>Without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Blood there
is no remiſſion,</hi> Hebr. 10.22. <hi>Ye are come to the Blood of
ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than that of</hi> Abel, Hebr.
12.24. <hi>According to the purification of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
1 Pet. 1.2. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Christ cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi>
1 John 1.7. <hi>Christ waſhed us from our ſins in his Blood,</hi> Apocal.
1.5. But the other quality of an Ignominious Death is ſignified by the very
Name of the Croſs: for in that very puniſhment there is great ignominy:
whence it is ſaid, <hi>He ſuffered the Croſs, having deſpiſed the
ſhame,</hi> Hebr. 1.2. And by the name of <hi>Contempt,</hi> which
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> uſed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.3. Here by the by it may be
obſerved, That not only in the places now alledged, and others like them,
that either only or chiefly treat of the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, there is
mention made of <pb n="14" facs="tcp:106819:12"/>Death, Croſs, Blood; but that in very
many places the Apoſtles did profeſs they <hi>knew nothing,</hi> they
<hi>taught nothing but Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.23. and 2.2.
and that therefore the Goſpel it ſelf is by them called <hi>the Word of the
Croſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.12. Moreover, Chriſt appointed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Sacrament
of his Supper not peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly for a Commemoration of his Life or
Reſurrection, but of his Death and the ſhedding of his Blood, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. Which things having been ſo often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do
manifeſtly ſhew, that ſome proper and peculiar Effect ſhould be
attributed unto this Death and Blood; which <hi>Socinus</hi> cannot do: For the
whole Life of Chriſt gave an Example of Holineſs, more than his Death it
ſelf, which was compleated in a ſhort time. But the Confirmation of that
Promiſe of <hi>Celeſtial Life,</hi> conſiſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the
Reſurrection of Chriſt, unto which Death is only as a way. So that the
Scripture looking towards this, ſhould have made mention of the
Reſurrection, not of Death; verily not ſo often, and with Marks of
Emphaſis adjoined. <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi>
3. endeavouring to ſhew that the way of Salvation was confirmed by the
Effuſion of Blood, when he had <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106819:12"/>taken away the true
Cauſe, which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, could not ſubſtitute any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Cauſe
of that Confirmation; neither could he bring any other true Difference, why
that ought to be attributed to the Death of Chriſt only, and not to the Death
of other Martyrs alſo. Neither can <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ever explain how
Chriſt obliged God to us, (which he himſelf grants to be true in ſome
ſenſe) if God hath promiſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the ſhedding of Blood.</p>
            <p>The Form is the ſuffering of Puniſhment for our Sins; which
<hi>Socinus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi>
4. ſtifly denies. Wherefore we will briefly prove this very thing. The
Hebrews, that they may ſignify that which the Latins call <hi>poenas
pendere,</hi> to ſuffer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, they have no phraſe more uſual
than this, <hi>ferre peccatum,</hi> to bear ſin. Like unto which is an
expreſſion of the Latins, <hi>lucre delicta,</hi> to ſuffer ſins, that
is, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſins. If any do not diſcover the Blaſphemer, he
<hi>feret peccatum</hi> ſhall bear his ſin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Qui
nuditatem So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roris ſue retexit, peccatum ſuum ferto:</hi> He that hath
uncovered his Siſters nakedneſs, let him bear his ſin, <hi>Lev.</hi>
20.17. So Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices are ſaid to <hi>bear</hi> the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of
them that offer them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.17. <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106819:13"/>becauſe their
Blood is for the <hi>ſoul of man,</hi> Lev. 17.11. Neither only conjunctly,
but alſo ſeparately, theſe words are found in the ſame ſenſe. So
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Chriſt carried up our ſins in his Body unto the Groſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2.24. He could have ſaid, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

ſignifies <hi>ferre,</hi> to bear, not <hi>auferre,</hi> to take away: which
the Text of <hi>Peter</hi> it ſelf proves. For the Diſcourſe is not
concerning any Benefit of Chriſt, but concerning his great Patience, which is
ſhewed, not by <hi>taking away,</hi> but by <hi>ſuffering.</hi> That
<hi>Socinus</hi> adds, That with this ſenſe whereby Chriſt is ſaid to
<hi>bear our ſins,</hi> that which follows doth not rightly enough cohere, it
is ſaid without cauſe; for <hi>Peter</hi> doth manifeſtly declare, That
Chriſt did ſo <hi>bear our ſins,</hi> that he might <hi>deliver us alſo
from puniſhment;</hi> whence he preſently adds, <hi>By his wounds ye are
made whole:</hi> But theſe cohere very well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If Chriſt underwent
ſuch hard things, that he might obtain the pardon of ſins, verily ye that
have obtained it, ought to beware of ſins in time to come. God hath given to
us, that being freed from the <hi>hand of our Enemies, we ſhould ſerve him
in all holineſs and righteouſneſs,</hi> Luke 1.74. <hi>Behold! thou art
made whole, ſin no more,</hi> John 5.14. <hi>Ye are bought with a price,
glorify therefore God in your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.20. Neither doth
<hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing in the Seventh, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106819:14"/>Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but ſhew that we ought
to be ſtirred up by the great Benefits of God and Chriſt, to live holily;
like unto that place of <hi>Peter</hi> (yea whither <hi>Peter</hi> certainly
had an eye, as it alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the words following, <hi>Ye were healed by
his ſtripes</hi>) is that of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11. <hi>My righteous Servant
ſhall juſtify many, and ſhall bear their ſins:</hi> In Hebrew it is
<hi>[Ve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonotam hou jisbal.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the word <hi>[avon]</hi> ſignifies <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and
alſo the <hi>puniſhment of Iniquity,</hi> as 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.9. but the
word <hi>[ſabal]</hi> ſignifies <hi>to bear</hi> or <hi>ſuſtain;</hi>
and as oft as <hi>to bear</hi> is put with the name of <hi>ſin,</hi> or
<hi>iniquity,</hi> that in every Tongue, and eſpecially in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſm,
ſignifies <hi>to bear puniſhment:</hi> For indeed <hi>[naſha]</hi>
ſometimes ſignifies <hi>to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> but <hi>[ſabal]</hi>
ſignifies not ſo: therefore here apparently Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>that he
will bear the puniſhment of them that are juſtified.</hi> This Phraſe
admits of no other Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: neither doth it hinder that this
<hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of iniquity</hi> ſeems to be put by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet after death:
for it is verily after death, not in time, but in order, as the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the
Cauſe exiſting together with it. But <hi>Socinus</hi> ſays that this word
<hi>[ſabal]</hi> being joined to <hi>ſin,</hi> doth not always include
ſome <pb n="20" facs="tcp:106819:15"/>imputation, but that it is enough if it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify a
man's being afflicted upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another man's deed: He proves
that by no Example; neither doth the Holy Scriptures ſpeak ſo at any time.
Yea alſo Greek and Latin Authors, when they uſe that Phraſe, do always
include impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>Socinus,</hi> for the confirming of this Exception,
cites a place of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> which is thus: <hi>Our Fathers ſinned,
and are not, and we bear their puniſhment:</hi> neither doth he ſuffer here
any imputation to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. But by what Argument doth he prove that
that Phraſe ſignifies another thing here, than in all other places where it
is put? <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf is compelled to confeſs, that as oft as
the Sons follow their Fathers footſteps, not only their own, but their
Fathers ſins are imputed unto them: for the Word of God is evident,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. But that thoſe, concerning whom <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
ſpeaks, were like their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that makes it evident, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in
the <hi>Prophet, Wo to us that we have ſinned,</hi> verſe 16. Neither is
this different from the intent of <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> for, that he may aggravate
the Miſery of thoſe that then lived, he ſaith, That the puniſhment both
of their own, and their Anceſtors ſins, <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106819:15"/>redounds upon
them: and that therefore the lot of their Fathers was much better than their
lot, who being alike guilty, were yet taken out of life, before that thoſe
very bitter puniſhments heaped up, as if it were in the Treaſure of Divine
Wrath, were at length poured forth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But though the ſignification of
theſe words, <hi>ferre peccata,</hi> to bear ſins, were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous in
Sacred Writings, yet both in this place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and in that of
<hi>Peter,</hi> the joint mention of the Sufferings of Chriſt, and our
Deliverance, would make the Interpretation certain. For <hi>to bear ſins</hi>
by <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and ſo, that others may be delivered from them,
cannot ſignify ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but the undertaking of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers puniſhment.
And in the ſame <hi>Iſaiah, verſ.</hi> 6. and 7. it is; <hi>God
caſt,</hi> or <hi>laid on him the puniſhment of us all: he is puniſhed,
and he is afflicted.</hi> Here <hi>Socinus</hi> moves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtone that he
may wreſt the genuine ſenſe from the words; and deviſeth a new
Interpretation: <hi>God did by him, or with him, go againſt the iniquity of
us all.</hi> But the Hebrew word doth manifeſtly contradict.
<hi>[Hiphgiah]</hi> being of that Conjunction which ſignifies not a ſingle,
but twofold Action: wherefore ſeeing <hi>[Phaga]</hi> properly ſignifies 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106819:16"/>
               <hi>to go againſt</hi> it follows that
<hi>[Hiphgiah]</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>he made to go against,</hi> and by
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor he deprecated, becauſe a perſon that deprecates, doth as it were
interpoſe his Prayers. To deprecate here hath not place: for then God
ſhould be ſaid to have deprecated for Chriſt; for that is the
ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of this word, the Particle <hi>(Beth)</hi> following,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 15.11. Neither doth <hi>fecit deprecari,</hi> he made to
deprecate, agree here, both becauſe <hi>[bo]</hi> on him, follows, when
otherways it ought to have been ſaid, <hi>He made him deprecate:</hi> and
alſo becauſe all things that next go before, and follow, pertain to
Affliction, not to Deprecation. Therefore theſe words do not bear another
ſenſe but this; God did make the ſins of us all <hi>occurrere illi,</hi>
to go againſt him; that is, <hi>impegit, incuſſit,</hi> he inflicted, or
he did caſt upon him: Sin is required, <hi>exigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur peccatum,</hi> (that is,
according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture phraſe) the puniſhment of ſin. <hi>Et ipſe
affligitur,</hi> and he is afflicted.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Socinus</hi> objects unto us that place of <hi>Lev.</hi>
16.21, and 22. where ſins are ſaid to be <hi>put upon the Goat of
Atonement,</hi> and the Goat himſelf is ſaid <hi>to carry the ſins of the
people into a waſte Wilderneſs.</hi> For he thought that nothing is more
manifeſt, <pb n="23" facs="tcp:106819:16"/>than that it could in no ways be ſaid that
this Goat ſuffered puniſhment for the ſins of the People: which, by what
right he takes upon him, I ſee not. For verily Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment taken in the
general, befals Beaſts alſo. <hi>The blood of all your Souls will I
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: Of every Beaſt will I require it,</hi> Gen. 9.5. <hi>When an Ox
ſhall puſh a Man or a Woman that he die, let that Ox be ſtoned,</hi>
Exod. 21.28. <hi>If any man lie with a Beaſt, let him be put to death, alſo
ſlay the Beaſt it ſelf,</hi> Lev. 20.15. <hi>The Earth was curſed with
a Deluge for man's ſake,</hi> Gen. 8.21. <hi>The Creature was ſubject to
vanity,</hi> Rom. 8.20. Neither is there Cauſe, why <hi>Socinus</hi> ſhould
object that this <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Scape-Goat did
not uſe to be killed; but that the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood, or death, was
required for the remiſſion of ſins: For though the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not
expreſly, declare, that that very Goat was thrown headlong from a high place
in the Wilderneſs, and ſo ſlain, the Hebrew Interpreters agree about it;
which though it were not ſo, yet what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing did that driving into a
waſte Wilderneſs threaten, but a death, not at all natural, either of
hunger, or the tearings of wild Beaſts? Alſo the word <hi>[Nagaſh]</hi>
is to be marked in <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> for it is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106819:17"/>that <hi>[Nagaſh] Schin</hi> having a point in the
left-horn, doth properly ſignify <hi>exigere,</hi> to <hi>require,</hi> as
appears 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.35. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.8. but metaphorically is taken
for <hi>opprimere,</hi> to oppreſs, therefore the Paſſive
<hi>[Nagaſh]</hi> is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>opprimitur,</hi> he is oppreſſed, or
<hi>exigitur,</hi> he is required. <hi>Opprimitur,</hi> he is oppreſſed,
hath no place here, becauſe it follows in the ſame <hi>[vehou]</hi>
Sentence, &amp; <hi>ipſe affligitur,</hi> and he is afflicted: whence it
appears that this Verb is referred to another Noun, than that unto which the
word <hi>affligitur,</hi> he is afflicted, is applied. Therefore it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that that word ſhould be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, that it may ſignify
<hi>exigitur,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and may be referred to the Noun immediately
going before. Now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſin, is, or can be nothing elſe but to
require the puniſhment of ſin; therefore the requiring of Puniſhment, and
Chriſt's Affliction, are joined together.</p>
            <p>There went before in the ſame Prophet, theſe words; <hi>The
Chaſtiſement of our peace was laid upon him, and by his ſtripes we are
healed.</hi> In the Hebrew <hi>Chaſtiſement</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>[Muſar]</hi> which word ſignifieth not <hi>every Affliction,</hi> but
that which hath a relation to Puniſhment, whether it is

               </gap>,

               </gap>, <hi>exemplary puniſhment;</hi>
for the uſe of that Hebrew word, is not found ſeparated from all reſpect
unto a fault. But here, if by the ſubject matter we underſtand the good of
Impunity, it will appear that Chriſt's Puniſhment, and our Impunity, are
very well oppoſed the one againſt the other: Though nothing hinders
Reconciliation to be underſtood by the name of Peace, though there was no
mention made of Enmity, which the matter it ſelf, and the following words of
the Prophet do abundantly declare to have went before. For neither did the
Angels make mention of Enmity, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that <hi>Peace was to
come upon the Earth</hi> Luke 2.14. nor the Apoſtle, when he ſaid, <hi>We
have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5.1. <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106819:18"/>And as the Hebrews put
<hi>Sin</hi> for <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as it appears, beſides other places
now alledged, <hi>Zachar.</hi> 14.19. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. ſo alſo the
ſame call him ſin, who ſuffers the puniſhment; as alſo the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
take <hi>piaculum</hi> both for the Crime, and alſo for him that ſuffers
the puniſhment of the Crime. Whence it is, that inſtead of
<hi>peccatum,</hi> ſin, the Scripture calls the <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hoſt,</hi> or
<hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> Sin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.29. and 5.6. Therefore
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this form of Speech, ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt,
<hi>[Taſhim aſham naphſho]</hi> he made his Soul ſin; that is, he made
his Soul ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the puniſhment of ſin. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeak otherways, <hi>For God made him, that knew no ſin, to become ſin,
that we might be the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.2. It
appears in the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> that in both Members the Adjunct is
taken for the Subject. <hi>Socinus,</hi> that he may invalidate the authority
of that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> by the word <hi>ſin,</hi> would have to be
underſtood, a man ſuppoſed by men to be a ſinner: Firſt without
Example; for no where is the Hebrew or Greek word ſo taken. Moreover,
<hi>Paul</hi> attributes this Action to God, that he made Chriſt ſin: But
yet that the Jews and others did <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106819:18"/>judge of Chriſt, as if
he had been a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and flagitious man, God is in no ways the Author of that
thing: yea, on the contrary, by a Voice from Heaven, and by working Miracles,
he did that which made the Innocency of Chriſt manifeſt unto all men.
Moreover, that new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Socinus,</hi> can in no ways a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to the words of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the like Phraſe; for that
which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid God did, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> attributes the ſame to
Chriſt, to wit, <hi>that he made his ſoul ſin,</hi> or, <hi>that he made
himſelf ſin.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth <hi>ſin</hi> and
<hi>righteouſneſs We are made the righteouſneſs of God;</hi> that is,
we are juſtified, or delivered from Divine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: but
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> that that might come to paſs, <hi>was made ſin;</hi>
that is, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Divine puniſhment. There is alſo another
Antitheſis to be obſerved in theſe ſame words of <hi>Paul:</hi> for
<hi>God made him that knew no ſin,</hi> that is, who deſerved no
puniſhment, <hi>to become ſin;</hi> that is, he would have him ſuffer
puniſhment: Chriſt was innocent, not only towards the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but alſo
the Divine Law. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the force of the oppoſition requires that he
ſhould alſo have ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Divine Law. Moreover, 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106819:19"/>it is a thing that daily comes to paſs, that the Innocent
are evil entreated by the Wicked: but here the Apoſtle obſerves ſome
excellent thing. And what other thing can this be, but that God laid
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on him that deſerved it not. Not unlike thoſe former places
is that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt redeemed
us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us: for it is written,

                  </gap>, Curſe, was in Chriſt the

puniſhment, and that is it, which we ſay. Perhaps <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> will
grant, that the Croſs was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, becauſe it was laid upon
Chriſt by <hi>Pilate</hi> the Judge in way of a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But this doth
not contain all that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid. For, that he may prove, that
Chriſt was made liable to puniſhment, he cites <hi>Moſes</hi> openly,
ſaying, <hi>That thoſe who are hanged</hi> (to wit, according to the Law of
God) <hi>are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<hi>Paul,</hi> citing <hi>Moſes,</hi> and referring theſe words to
Chriſt: as if he had ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt was made
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Accurſed of God:</hi> that is,
liable to the puniſhment inflicted by God, and that very ignominious. For the
Apoſtles, when they refer the Paſſion of Chriſt to our uſes, they do
not therein look at the deeds of men, but at the fact of God himſelf; as is
manifeſt by many places before mentioned.</p>
            <p>To all theſe things this alſo may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That Death it
ſelf, that is the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that perſon, which is made up of 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106819:20"/>a Body and Soul, inaſmuch as it is inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God,
hath always ſome ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of puniſhment: Not that God hath no power
otherways to inflict it upon man, (for he is Lord of the Creature) but
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeemed good otherways to his Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>That the ſtate of this peculiar Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy may be rightly
underſtood; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, that Man, when he was created, was
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>earthly,</hi> who had a
certain vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtrength, but not a life-giving ſtrength, as <hi>Paul</hi>
teacheth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45,46. and therefore that was the Condition of
the Body, that it would have periſhed, unleſs God ſuſtained it; yet we
contend, that by the decree of God, he was not to die, if he had continued in
Innocency. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and eminency of that Creature proveth this, as
being the only Creature that is ſaid to be <hi>made after the Image of
God,</hi> that is, endued with a Mind and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, which is the Foundation of
his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over other Creatures; for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Lord of other things, who
is not Lord of his own Actions. Therefore this Excellency above other
Creatures, is an Argument, that ſomething more than a Temporal uſe was
regarded in the Creation <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106819:20"/>of Man. And now what is more clear
than that Divine Word? <hi>If thou eatest, thou ſhalt die.</hi> Here the
Diſcourſe is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Act of Death, whether it was to be violent, or
without violence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Death it ſelf would not have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Man,
unleſs the Condition of Sin had been. No leſs clear and general is that of
<hi>Paul, The wages,</hi> that is, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, <hi>is
death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Before, he had ſaid, <hi>By ſin came death, and ſo
death paſſed upon all men. All men,</hi> ſaith he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he treats
of the common event of all Mankind. <hi>Therefore by man,</hi> that is, by
human fact, <hi>came death; and by man came the reſurrection of the dead. As
in</hi> Adam <hi>all die,</hi> (as many as die) <hi>ſo in Chriſt all
ſhall be made alive,</hi> (as many as ſhall be made alive) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15.21,22. Who read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe very words, ſees not that this ſaying to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> is exactly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that to the <hi>Romans?</hi>
Therefore the Diſcourſe is concerning Death, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the
Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> and from which they do riſe again, which riſe
again. Wherefore alſo this place being compared with that to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> we ſay the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is here concerning <hi>Adam</hi> a
ſinner: for what he ſaid here by man, there he <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106819:21"/>ſaid
by ſin. The Animal Condition of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> is diſcourſed upon in
Twenty Verſes, and more, by the Apoſtle, on a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent occaſion:
for here Death is oppoſed to the Reſurrection; but there the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of
the Body, at the firſt created, and afterwards raiſed again, are compared
with one another: of which, that had joined with a natural poſſibility of
dying, by the bounty of God, a poſſibility alſo of living: but this
ſhall ſo have life in it ſelf, that it ſhall be without any natural
poſſibility of dying.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot omit the adding of an excellent place of the very
excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which though it is not in
the Hebrew Canon, yet it hath a venerable Antiquity, and was always had in
eſtimation among Chriſtians. <hi>So then</hi> ſaith he,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 1.13. And next;
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106819:21"/> 2.23.
<hi>God made not Death, neither doth he delight in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of living
Creatures: for he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things to have Exiſtence, and their
Generations are healthful, and the Poiſon of deſtruction is not in them,
neither is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Hell upon Earth: But Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is
immortal. But the ungodly with their hands and words, called it to them, and
thinking it to be their Friend, were conſumed, and made a Covenant with it,
becauſe they are worthy to have a portion with it. God created Man for
uncorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made him the Image of his own Deity; but by the Envy of the
Devil, Death came into the World, and they have Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of it that are on
its ſide.</hi> Here he ſhews, that any kind of Death is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
which Death God is ſaid not to have created, nor to deſire, to wit, with a
will going before ſin, in oppoſition to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, for the hope whereof
Man is ſaid to be created, and that hope is not obſcurely declared to have
been a part of the Divine Image, or at leaſt a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereof. But
Uncorruption ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106819:22"/>all Death, whether it is violent, or
not violent. And what the Apoſtle ſaid, That by Man and by Sin Death
entred; this Author ſaid no leſs truly, That Death entred by the Envy of
the Devil. For all theſe Expreſſions ſignify the ſame Fact, to wit,
That the firſt Sin of Man was committed by the Suggeſtion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
Neither doth it hinder, that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor obſerves a certain ſpecial Effect
of Death upon the Wicked; for Death ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entred by the firſt ſin, and
gained power over all Men, gets a certain pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſtrength by the great and
continual ſins of every Man; in which ſenſe ſin is called <hi>the
ſting of death,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56. Therefore thoſe, from whom, after their
death, all paſſage to life is ſhut up, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly called the
<hi>Confederates of Death,</hi> or its <hi>Bondſlaves,</hi> and <hi>peculiar
Poſſeſſion.</hi> It might very eaſily be demonſtrated, if this were
the thing that is treated upon, that this was the conſtant Opinion, both of
Jews and Chriſtians, that any kind of death of a Man is a puniſhment of
ſin: ſo that the Chriſtian Emperours, not without cauſe, diſallowed
that Opinion, beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celeſtius,</hi>
that they ſaid, <hi>That Death did not flow from the <pb n="35" facs="tcp:106819:22"/>ſnare of ſin, but that the Law of an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Appointment
required it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that we may gather the things that hitherto have been ſaid,
into one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt was chaſtiſed
by God,</hi> that is, was puniſhed; <hi>That Chriſt did bear our
ſins,</hi> (that is, the puniſhment of our ſins;) <hi>That he was made
ſin,</hi> that is, ſubjected to the puniſhment of ſin; <hi>That he was
made a Curſe unto God,</hi> or <hi>liable to the Curſe,</hi> that is, the
puniſhment of the Law: But the Paſſion of Chriſt it ſelf, having been
full of Torments, bloody and ignominious, is a very fit matter of puniſhment.
Moreover, becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>That theſe things were
inflicted on him by God for our ſins,</hi> (that is, our ſins ſo
deſerving) <hi>becauſe Death it ſelf is called the wages,</hi> that is,
the puniſhment of ſin; verily it cannot be juſtly doubted, that in
reſpect of God, the Paſſion and Death of Chriſt was a puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Neither are the Interpretations of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> worthy to be
regarded, which devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates from the conſtant uſe of words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Example,
eſpecially becauſe no juſt reaſon hindereth to retain the
ſignification of the words, which ſhall appear more evident afterwards.
Therefore in God the <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106819:23"/>puniſhment is actively, in Chriſt
paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: yet to whoſe Paſſion a certain volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Action is
joyned, to wit, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Penal Paſſion.</p>
            <p>The end of the thing that is diſcourſed upon, according to the
Intention of God and Chriſt, which being placed in act, may alſo be called
an Effect, is twofold; to wit, a Demonſtration of the Divine
Righteouſneſs, and the Remiſſion of Sins, in reſpect of us, that is,
our Impunity. For if you take the exacting of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imperſonally,
it's end is the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Divine Righteouſneſs; but if you take
it perſonally, that is, wherefore Chriſt was puniſhed, the end is, that
we might obtain freedom from puniſhment. The former end is expreſſed by
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith concerning Chriſt, <hi>Whom God hath appointed
for a Propitiation in his Blood, for the demonſtration of his
Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for the pardoning the foregoing ſins in the forbearance
of God.</hi> Afterwards he adds, repeating almoſt the ſame words; <hi>To
declare his Righteouſneſs at this time, that he may be the juſtifier of
him that is of the Faith of Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3.25,26. Here, next unto his
Blood, that is, his bloody Death, is joyned the end,

our peace was upon him;</hi> that is, his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment procures us peace with
God; concerning which peace the Angels ſpeak, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. And that of
the ſame <hi>Iſaiah, By his ſtripes we are cured;</hi> that is, by his
puniſhment we have freedom from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>By theſe Teſtimonies therefore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the
impunity of our ſins is the End of the Death of Chriſt, and alſo an
Effect of the ſame Death. <hi>Socinus,</hi> who is not willing to acknowledge
this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of <hi>Death</hi> with the <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi>
performed unto us, brings others wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <pb n="45" facs="tcp:106819:27"/>different
from the words and ſcope of the Scripture. But all theſe, that he hath here
and there ſcattered in his Book, ſeem to be reducible to theſe four
Heads.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>That Chriſt, when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the
remiſſion of ſins lyes open to the Penitent, did not refuſe Death, to
give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to that Preaching.</hi> But this ſenſe makes the Death of
Chriſt an Effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, more than remiſſion of Death: For the
Exiſtence of a thing, is the cauſe of a Teſtimony, not contrariways. But
the Scrripture ſays, that <hi>we obtain remiſſion by Blood,</hi> Epheſ.
1.7. Coloſſ. 1.14. And that <hi>Blood blots out our ſins,</hi> 1 John
1.7. Alſo that the <hi>ſhedding of Blood</hi> is a thing Antecedent,
<hi>without which there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> Hebr. 9.22. Moreover, if
this Interpretation were true, the Martyrs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo might be ſaid to have
ſhed their Blood for the remiſſion of ſins, and that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
remiſſion by that Blood, when yet the Scripture gives this priviledge to
Chriſt only. Moreover, the Cauſe of the Killing of Chriſt, in reſpect
of men, was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the preaching of Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of
Sins, but that he called God his <hi>Father,</hi> making himſelf <hi>equal to
God.</hi> 
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:106819:28"/>John 5.18. and conſequently that he did
profeſs himſelf to be <hi>God.</hi> For which cauſe his Death gave
properly a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to this Profeſſion, not to the preaching of Pardon.
And alſo a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony concerning the Doctrine was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no leſs, but
more by the Miracles, than by the Death of Chriſt. But no where is this
Effect attributed unto Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that by them <hi>we obtain Remiſſion of
ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that <hi>Socinus</hi> brings, is, <hi>That
Chriſt by his Death obtained the power of giving Remiſſion.</hi> But
<hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturns this Poſition, who ſheweth that
Chriſt, living on Earth, had, and exerciſed this Power. But that which is,
cannot be any more made mine. And leſt any man ſhould ſo miſtake (which
<hi>Socinus</hi> doth more hint at, than affirm) as if this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt
had only reſpect to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Temporal, and of this Life, it muſt be
obſerved, That when Chriſt is ſaid to have had <hi>power</hi> upon earth
<hi>to forgive ſins,</hi> the Effect is not reſtrained by that Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>on Earth,</hi> but the place of the Action is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> emphatically expreſſed. For
it is alſo ſaid to the Apoſtles, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on
Earth,</hi> where though to <hi>looſe</hi> 
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:106819:28"/>is to declare
<hi>to be looſed,</hi> yet that Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>on the Earth,</hi>
ſignifies only the place of the Action: for it follows, <hi>they ſhall be
looſed in Heaven.</hi> For that is it, which Chriſt ſignified; that that
Power, though ſo eminent, and Celeſtial, belonged to him, living on the
Earth: Neither do the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wonder at any other thing, but that <hi>ſo
great power was given to men,</hi> (that is,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by enallagy to one of the number
of men) Chriſt himſelf alſo firſt forgives the ſins of the man, that
had the Palſy, before he takes away the Palſy, which was a Temporal
Puniſhment; and manifeſtly diſtinguiſhing both Powers, he proves the
one by the other, to wit, the inviſible by the viſible. Then Chriſt did
not at length obtain the power to forgive ſins by his Death; and
conſequently thoſe ſayings, which aſcribe the Effect of the
remiſſion of ſins to his Death, cannot be drawn to this ſenſe.
Moreover, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture explains the way of the Connexion between
<hi>Death</hi> and Remiſſion, by the word <hi>Propitiation,</hi> and other
ſuch like words, which cannot be applied to the power of giving Pardon.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, <hi>That in the Death of Chriſt an Example of
Patience and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <pb n="48" facs="tcp:106819:29"/>is propoſed to us.</hi> But this
Example, in ſome reſpect, pertains to Sanctification, and, that which
follows it, Eternal Glory; but not any ways to the remiſſion of ſins: for
Chriſt by his Patience and Obedience obtained no pardon to himſelf, as
having no ſin. Wherefore, when Chriſt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for Imitation, that we
keeping that way, which he went, may come to the ſame Mark, nothing would be
more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, than to make any mention of remiſſion of ſins.
And the Phraſes of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Blood cleanſeth us, By his Blood we have
Remiſſion,</hi> do utterly reject this ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing remains, which moſt pleaſed <hi>Socinus.</hi>
So that in very many places he inculcates this, as the ſupport of his
Cauſe: and it is this, <hi>That the Death of Chriſt perſwades us to that
very thing, that is required for the obtaining remiſſion of ſins, to wit,
Faith, or, as</hi> Socinus <hi>explains himſelf, the hope of obtaining
Eternal Life.</hi> But verily, what is more diſagreeable unto truth, than
that ſo bloody a death of a moſt innocent man, doth of it ſelf conduce
unto this, that it may perſwade us, that great Joys are prepared by God for
us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving holily. Wherefore <hi>Socinus</hi> ſeeing the <pb n="49" facs="tcp:106819:29"/>abſurdity of this Invention, ſaith, <hi>That the Death of Chriſt
doth not this, but his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and thoſe things that followed his
Reſurrection: But, that it was requiſite Death ſhould go before.</hi> But
if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture had ſignified ſo, it would have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned perpetually
the Reſurrection, or rather the Exaltation unto Heaven, and ſitting at the
right hand of God, where forgiveneſs of ſins is diſcourſed of, not
Death and Blood, at leaſt not ſo often, and in words ſo ſignificant:
For that ſo frequent and uſual joyning of <hi>Blood</hi> with
<hi>Remiſſion,</hi> ſignifies ſome Effect not common, but proper, not
far remote, but near hand. For what By-ways are theſe? The Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of
ſins is granted unto none, but them that live holily; (for ſo ſpeaks
<hi>Socinus:</hi>) Faith, and a certain hope of reward, makes for holineſs of
Life: This Faith is begotten by the Example of Chriſt, raiſed from the
Dead, and glorified for holineſs of Life, (as <hi>Socinus</hi> would have it)
Death went before that raiſing up: therefore rightly and fitly is
<hi>Remiſſion</hi> ſaid to be obtained by the <hi>Death of Chriſt.</hi>
Is not this it really, which he finds fault with in others; <hi>Alas! That the
Pine-tree was cut in the Pelian Wood!</hi> for that is brought for a 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106819:30"/>cauſe, which is not ſome near thing, or at leaſt not
far diſtant; but that which is moſt remote from the Effect. What if this
had been in one place of Scripture, it would perhaps have been leſs
wonderful? But what man, that is in his right wits, can believe that the
Scripture ſpeaks ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo obſcurely and ſo coldly? That Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Paul</hi> is very unlike, <hi>Chriſt was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dead for
our juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. Which, that it may be explained, there is
no need to fetch ſo long a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of <hi>Socinus.</hi> For the
Reſurrection of Chriſt begets in us Faith and Reliance on God and Chriſt:
to which Faith is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Remiſſion of ſins. And this Series is
manifeſtly ſhewed <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33,38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. and 10.9. for
Death is ſo far from being fit to beget Faith, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it
moſt affrighteth men from that Faith. And therefore in preaching the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel the Apoſtles do always oppoſe the Reſurrection to the Ignominy
of the Croſs, and the Miſery of Death. But that by <hi>Death,</hi> and the
<hi>ſhedding of Blood,</hi> which the Scripture frequently expreſſeth in
this Argument, which is not properly a Cauſe of the Reſurrection, but only
an Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he would have the Reſurrection it <pb n="51" facs="tcp:106819:30"/>ſelf
to be expreſſed; What is it elſe but to name Night, that thereby Day may
be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood? Moreover, if Death did not belong to the Remiſſion of
ſins, except becauſe of the Reſurrection that followed, how could it have
happened, that Remiſſion of ſins was very ſeldom referred to the
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but to Death in innumerable places? Now add this alſo, that
<hi>Paul</hi> doth attribute to Death it ſelf apart, that is, as it is
abſtracted from the Reſurrection and Glory of Chriſt, the Effect of
Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on purchaſed. For he ſays, <hi>If, when we were Enemies, we were
reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, much more being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled we
ſhall be ſaved by his Life,</hi> Rom. 5.10. <hi>Death</hi> is oppoſed
unto a <hi>glorious Life,</hi> and as <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is aſcribed
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly unto that, ſo is <hi>Preſervation</hi> unto this.
Reconciliation is obtained for Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by Death, as a Sacerdotal Act: being
reconciled, they are kept by his Kingly Power, unto which Reſurrection made
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. So alſo elſewhere the ſame Apoſtle puts
<hi>Reconciliation</hi> before <hi>Preaching,</hi> which begets <hi>Faith. God
was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their ſins
unto them; and did put in us the Word of Reconciliation: therefore we are
Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours <pb n="52" facs="tcp:106819:31"/>for Chriſt, and, as if God were
requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by us, we beſeech you in Christ's ſtead, be ye reconciled
unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19,20. Here a twofold <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is put;
the former, which is declared by the Word: the other, that is made by the Word:
that is the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of <hi>Impetration,</hi> this of
<hi>Application:</hi> that is before the Word, this is after the Word. We treat
of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and do juſtly deny that it can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the
Ingeneration of Faith which comes by the Word. That alſo may be added
<hi>John</hi> 3.16. where Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be given</hi> (to wit,
<hi>unto death</hi>) <hi>that they who believe, may not periſh.</hi>
Therefore it is profitable for another thing than that they may believe. And
verily if you pleaſe to <hi>attend,</hi> the ſame thing is not obſcurely
ſhewed in that very place of <hi>Paul,</hi> which is by <hi>Socinus</hi>
cited for to confirm his own Opinions, to wit, that, of which we
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed: <hi>who was delivered</hi> (to wit, <hi>unto death</hi>)
<hi>for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtification.</hi> Becauſe
<hi>Sins</hi> are an evil thing, and <hi>Juſtification</hi> a good thing, it
appears that the word <hi>propter,</hi> for, is not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in both
Members: and it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the final Cauſe ſhould be expreſſed
in the latter Member; if I am not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <pb n="53" facs="tcp:106819:31"/>we
ſufficiently ſhewed above, that in the former the Impulſive Cauſe is
ſignified. Juſt as if I ſay, that a Medicine is taken for a Diſeaſe
and for Health: Therefore Juſtification is the end propoſed unto the
Reſurrection, to wit, by the Ingeneration of Faith, by the Confeſſion of
<hi>Socinus.</hi> Though verily I know not whether the Reſurrection in this
place is looked upon as an Argument to perſwade Faith, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it rather
ſignifies the whole glorious ſtate of Chriſt, who hath this end
propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to himſelf amongſt others, that the Preachers of the Goſpel
may be ſent, and that their Endeavour may be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a very plentiful
Influence of the Spirit, and Faith being made after that manner, men may obtain
the Remiſſion of ſins: for ſo ſaid Chriſt himſelf; <hi>All Power
is given to me in Heaven and in Earth: Therefore go ye and teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Behold, I am with you always to the end of the World,</hi> Matth. 28.18,19,20.
Before, as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Spirit was not</hi> (to wit)
<hi>poured forth with that efficacy and abundance;</hi> the cauſe is added,
<hi>becauſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was not yet exalted to Glory,</hi> John 7.39.
<hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaid of <hi>Chriſt, When he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended on high,
he led Captivity captive, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:106819:32"/>and gave gifts to men: He gave
ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, others Prophets, and others Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and others
Paſtors and Teachers to the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> Epheſ. 4.8,12.
But whether of theſe two ways you take it, it appears that ſome peculiar
and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Reſurrection, inaſmuch as it is diſtinguiſhed
from Death. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, it is aſcribed unto Death apart, or
deliverance unto Death, that it happened for ſins: but that very thing is no
where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto the Reſurrection, and in this place it is not
obſcurely taken from the ſame. But the Death of Chriſt in this Affair is
both to be ſeparated from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and from the Ingeneration of
Faith; and in theſe places, which deduce the Remiſſion of ſins from the
Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, a certain diſtinct Effect is to be underſtood,
which the very ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Words import, agreeing with other words of
Scripture, which ſay, <hi>That Christ for our ſins died a bloody death, and
that the puniſhment of our ſins was exacted of him;</hi> concerning which
things we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready treated: and with thoſe words of Scripture which
teſtifie not obſcurely, <hi>That God was appeaſed and reconciled to us by
the Blood of Chriſt; That his Blood was <pb n="55" facs="tcp:106819:32"/>a price given for
us; That Chriſt died in our ſtead and was our Propitiation;</hi> of which
there will be occaſion to ſpeak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>

being confirmed by Scriptures, on which the Faith of the Church is ſupported,
that the Objections, which the Reaſon of <hi>Socinus,</hi> or rather the
abuſe of his Reaſon, furniſh-him with, may be routed, it is requiſite,
that it ſhould be underſtood, What is God's part or office in this matter
to be diſcourſed of. <hi>Socinus</hi> confeſſes, <hi>That the
Diſcourſe is concerning Deliverance from Puniſhment.</hi> We add,
<hi>That the Inflicting of Puniſhment is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo treated of.</hi> Whence it
follows, <hi>That God <pb n="56" facs="tcp:106819:33"/>muſt needs be here conſidered as
a Governour.</hi> For to inflict Puniſhment, or to Deliver a man from
Puniſhment, whom thou mayeſt puniſh, which the Scripture calls <hi>to
juſtifie,</hi> is only the part of a Governour, as ſuch, firſtly and of
it ſelf: As for Example, Of a Father in a Family; Of a King in a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; Of God in the Univerſe. Though this is manifeſt unto all,
yet it may be eaſily proved, becauſe Puniſhment is the laſt thing in
Compulſion: but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion belongs only to a Superior,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to the higher Power;</hi>
whence <hi>Seneca</hi> called <hi>Clemency the meekneſs of a Superiour
towards an Inferiour in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Puniſhment.</hi> Neither doth it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Revenge ſeems ſometimes to be attributed to men private, and
furniſhed with no ſuperior Power. For that Revenge is either of fact, not
of right, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to natural Juſtice it ſelf; or it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a certain right belonging to ſome man not firſt and of it ſelf, but by
the conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another; whence the Father of the raviſhed Maid kills
the Raviſher, and any man kills the baniſhed man; or it ſignifies not the
Act of Puniſhment it ſelf, but the requiring of the Puniſhment to be
inflicted, either by God himſelf, or by another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106819:33"/>Unto which ways of revenging, ſo many ways of
remiſſion of ſins or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don are anſwerable, which both Scripture and
common Speech attributes to private men.</p>
            <p>But this Aſſertion needs ſo much the leſs proof, becauſe
<hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where confeſſeth, <hi>That God ſhould
be looked upon as a Prince in puniſhing and abſolving men;</hi> then which
nothing more true can be ſaid. Neither did <hi>James</hi> ſignifie any
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, when he ſaid <hi>there is one Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, who can ſave and
deſtroy,</hi> James 4.12. Therefore in this matter we have a new
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, <hi>habitude of God,</hi> which
being found, it is eaſie to remove all others.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, We grant this to <hi>Socinus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it, That
here God ſhould not be looked upon as a Judge appointed under a Law; for he
that is ſuch a Judge could not free the Offender from puniſhment, by
tranſlating the puniſhment upon another. Not becauſe that of it ſelf it
is unjuſt, but becauſe it agrees not with the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is choſen
a Miniſter. Which <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> expreſſed in theſe words,
concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Anger of God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>A Judge cannot give pardon
to Offences, becauſe he is ſubject to the Will of another: But God can, 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106819:34"/>becauſe he himſelf is the Decider of his own Law, which
when he appointed, verily he took not away all power from himſelf, but hath
liberty to forgive. Seneca ſays, well; Clemency hath a Free-will, not under a
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but judgeth according to juſtice and Goodneſs; for Equity
belongs to a Judge ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Form of Law: but Clemency pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called,
belongs only to the higheſt Governour in every Community.</hi> The ſame
<hi>Seneca</hi> bids a Prince think on this: <hi>Any man may kill againſt the
Law, bur none can ſave againſt the Law but my ſelf. Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> took
notice of this diſtinction; <hi>It is appointed by the Judges, that it
ſhould not be lawful to repeal a Sentence given againſt a guilty perſon.
Will the Emperour alſo be under this Law? For it is lawful to him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to
repeal a Sentence, and abſolve a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon guilty of Death, and to pardon
him.</hi> And <hi>Symmachus: For there is one condition of Magiſtrates,
whoſe Sentences ſeem to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, if they are milder than the Laws;
and there is another power of Sacred Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whom it becomes to mitigate the
ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſevere Law.</hi> Unto which alſo <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> had
reſpect, when he ſaid for <hi>Ligarius</hi> to <hi>Caeſar: I did not, I
thought not; ſuch Arguing uſeth to be before a Judge; but I 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106819:34"/>ſay to a Father, I have erred, I did raſhly, I repent;
I fly to thy Clemency, I beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the fault, I beſeech you that you
would pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Socinus,</hi> though in the place above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, he looks upon
God as the higheſt Prince, yet in many places in all this act he attributes
another <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>habitude,</hi> to
him, to wit, of a Party offended. And he would have every offended Party to be
the Creditor of the Puniſhment; and therein to have ſuch a power, as other
Creditors have in things owing to them. Which power he often calleth by the
name of <hi>Lordſhip:</hi> therefore he very often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats, that here God
ſhould be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a <hi>Party offended,</hi> as a <hi>Creditor,</hi>
as a <hi>Lord,</hi> putting theſe three as ſignifying the ſame thing.
This Error of <hi>Socinus,</hi> becauſe it is largely ſpread abroad through
his whole Treatiſe, and may be ſaid to be in this matter his
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

be confuted accurately.</p>
            <p>That this may be performed, this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion may be put firſt.
<hi>To puniſh, is not an Act belonging to the Party offended, as ſuch,</hi>
this is proved; becauſe otherways the power of Puniſhment of it ſelf
would belong to every offended Party; which <pb n="60" facs="tcp:106819:35"/>appears to be
falſe; becauſe we proved that to puniſh is an act
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Superiority.</hi> By the
Confeſſion of <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf, when he ſays, <hi>That God
ſhould be look'd upon as a Prince,</hi> whence another firm Argument
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth; <hi>If God puniſheth, and taketh away puniſhment as a Prince,
then not as a Party offended: for the ſame thing cannot be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to two
divers things as ſuch.</hi> But at the ſame time we deny not, that God who
puniſheth ſins, or lets them go unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is rightly called the
offended Party. But we deny that to puniſh, or let go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, is
attributed to him as an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Party. For it is very well known, that a
thing may be ſaid of a man, that doth not agree to him as ſuch: as a
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller of Law ſings, not as a Counſeller of Law, but as a
Muſician. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this rightly. <hi>We riſe to
puniſhment, not becauſe we are injured, but that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline may be
preſerved, Manners may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, Licentiouſneſs may be
reſtrained.</hi> This is juſt Anger, which as it is neceſſary in man,
ſo verily is it in God; from whom the Example came to Man. It is a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Rule, <hi>That no Man is a fit Judge in his own Cauſe:</hi> But this Rule is
not of Natural Law, but Poſitive, and therefore not U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal. 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106819:35"/>For it hath not any place in the higheſt Governours,
under which name I alſo comprehend Parents, in reſpect of the care of the
Family. Lawyers obſerve that Emperours judge in their own Cauſe, <hi>ad l.
&amp; hoc Tiberius de Hoere. inſtit.</hi> This alſo may come to paſs in
Crimes, as in the Judgment of Treaſon, and in Wars, which for the Injury
offered to the King, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the King. Of which thing there is a
famous Example, 2 <hi>Kings ch.</hi> 10. Therefore Princes, though offended,
but not as offended, puniſh Crimes, or let them go unpuniſht; for if they
did that, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, then others, being injured, would have the ſame power,
who nevertheleſs can neither puniſh the Offender, nor cauſe him to be
unpuniſhed. Again, if it ſhould belong to Princes, as offended, to puniſh
or let go unpuniſhed, then they would have no power to puniſh Crimes, in
which they were not offended; the contrary whereof Reaſon and Experience
ſheweth. And leſt Men ſhould be miſtaken by this Errour, as if evil
doers were therefore puniſhed by a Prince, becauſe they hurt the
Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whereof he is Governour; we ſee, that Subjects alſo, who
have grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended out of the Territory, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt 
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106819:36"/>a forreiner are rightly and with praiſe puniſhed.
Whence it manifeſtly appears, That the power of puniſhing doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to an offended perſon as offended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, the Offence being committed,
this power doth not immediately follow, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it removed when the Offence
is removed: But on the contrary, the ſame right belongs to a Superiour as a
Superiour; for as ſoon as you put Superiority, you alſo put the power of
puniſhing, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, you remove it. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is
ſaid of the power of inflicting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, it is neceſſary the ſame
ſhould be underſtood concerning the power of giving freedom from
puniſhment; for theſe things are by a natural Bond joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Perhaps <hi>Socinus</hi> was miſtaken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſmetimes in Sacred
Writings, and amongſt others, in the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> the Example of
God forgiving ſins is propoſed unto us, that we alſo being offended, may
forgive others their ſins. But he ought to have conſidered, that Examples
are taken not only from things that are the ſame, <hi>genere proximo,</hi> in
the next kind, but alſo from thoſe things that have ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
chiefly becauſe ſome ſelf-ſame name is put upon things, though divers
in their <pb n="63" facs="tcp:106819:36"/>next kind, becauſe of reſemblance. So Chriſt
forbids us to <hi>judge,</hi> to wit unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, leſt we our ſelves
alſo be <hi>judged:</hi> and adds, <hi>That with what meaſure we mete unto
others, with the ſame it ſhall be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured unto us,</hi> Math. 7.1,2.
where that former judging in its whole kind differs from the other: For the
former is the judgment of Liberty; the other the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Power. After the
ſame manner it is a far other thing in God, and in other Governours, to
forgive ſins, and another thing in private perſons offended by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for to puniſh is oppoſed to that, but to the other to require puniſhment,
or wiſh it, or alſo to complain, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.13. therefore they
differ intrinſecally, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally in ſome reſpect they agree;
for the moving Cauſe to both is Bounty or Love to Mankind,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: but the Effect is, that he, who
hath ſinned, is freed from ſome Inconvenience, either really, or at
leaſt, as much as lies in the forgiver; which Agreement is ſufficient that
the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may have its own efficacy.</p>
            <p>This may be the other Aſſertion: <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the offended
Party, as ſuch, hath no power in puniſhment.</hi> This is ſomewhat more
than what the firſt Aſſertion had <pb n="64" facs="tcp:106819:37"/>gathered. For there
we denied that the very act of puniſhing belongs to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Party: Here
we deny that any power belongs unto it, not only to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the act of it
ſelf, but alſo to oblige another to exerciſe: that is, that the Party
offended is not really a Creditor in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which yet <hi>Socinus</hi>
thinketh, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeats it, as a moſt certain thing. Here I underſtand
a Creditour, not in a ſtrict ſignification, according to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of
the word, him that hath given credit to another man's word; but more
general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Creditors are they to whom Debt is due for any Cauſe. And it is
thus proved, that it is true, that we ſay: It is very well known that Right
is twofold, Natural or Poſitive: wherefore it is neceſſary that all Debt
ſhould ariſe hence or thence. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Right conſiſts in the
Adequation of things among themſelves; ſuch therefore alſo is Natural
Debt. But Poſitive Right is that which proceeds from a free act of the Will:
which is twofold, Contract, and Law-Contract, is an Effect of that Power, that
any man hath over himſelf, and his own things: But Law is an Effect of that
Power, which any man hath over another man, and another man's things. Here we 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106819:37"/>treat not of Poſitive Death; therefore we add the word
Naturally: the Cauſe of which thing we ſhall explain afterwards. Now by
Nature nothing elſe is due to me by thy Deed, neither indeed can be due, but
an equality according to the thing; that is, that as much as I want by thy
means, ſo much ſhould be reſtored: It may be called by this one word,
<hi>Indemnity</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi> Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
rightly called a Creditor <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

the ſame <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves. For as thou art obliged to
reſtore that which was lent or entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo alſo the thing that was
taken away by Theft. And in this ſenſe we may na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally become Creditors
through a fault. Neither hath that place only in theſe faults, in which the
receiving of a Corporal thing is interpoſed, but alſo in other facts
hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a man: So he that hath wounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, ought both to pay
Rewards to the Phyſicians, and the Charges laid out for the Cure, and Damage
of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Some have wondered that <hi>Aristotle</hi> did put

               </gap>, <hi>a juſtice of making
right</hi> is exerciſed. <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106819:38"/>But <hi>Euſtathius</hi> well
obſerved, That <hi>that comes to paſs no other way, but becauſe there
uſeth to be ſome Recompenſe made unto the Wife, Children or Kinſmen of
the ſlain man.</hi> So alſo he who hath hurt the Good Name of another by a
Lie, ought, by the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Truth, to make up what he detracted
from his Credit. By all which it appears, that what is naturally due through
Faults, is different from Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the Cauſe of that natural Debt
is firſt, and of it ſelf not the viciouſneſs of the Act, but becauſe
ſome thing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me: for though it is abſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Fault, as
in a thing entruſted, yet no leſs is Reſtitution due to me. But the
cauſe of the Puniſhment is the viciouſneſs of the Act, and not
becauſe I want ſomething. For though no man wants any thing, the Act will
be rightly puniſhed, as in great Crimes, which were only begun, and were not
compleated. There is alſo another difference, no leſs remarkable, that the
Nature of a thing it ſelf determines the manner and quantity of the
Reſtitution. Puniſhment, though in its own kind it hath a Natural Cauſe
in ſome ſenſe (as we ſhall ſay afterwards) yet it cannot be
determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but by a free Act of the Will. Add <pb n="67" facs="tcp:106819:38"/>this
alſo, that Puniſhment, inaſmuch as it conſiſts in ſpeaking, or
doing, is not due ordinarily before Condemnation, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in all
reſpects is due. The Debt of Reſtitution paſſeth unto the Heir, the
Puniſhment paſſeth not. Which I judge requiſite to mention only for
this Cauſe, leſt any ſhould raſhly confound that which is due to the
offended with Puniſhment. But yet it is true, that by a poſitive Law, as
alſo by a Contract way may be made, that a Creditor may obtain a right for
Puniſhment, which then alſo the Laws di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh from the purſuit of
a thing, or of damage, <hi>L. ſi pignore parag. cum fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti d. de furtis
inſtit. de lega Aquilia parag.</hi> and in theſe words. But this uſeth
for the moſt part to be appointed in pecuniary puniſhments, which not only
bring Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to him, who did the hurt, but alſo Gain to him that was hurt.
But in Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhments, in which there is no true Gain of the perſon
that was injured, this is ſcarcely exerciſed. And therefore we ſee Kings,
and other chief Governours, forgive puniſhment to the Guilty, againſt the
will of the Party wronged, commanding them only to make Reſtitution of the
Damage; which no man judgeth unjuſt. But this <pb n="68" facs="tcp:106819:39"/>would be
unjuſt if puniſhment were due to the Party wronged, eſpecially where no
neceſſity of the Common-wealth required remiſſion. Wherefore that
leſſer Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates cannot remit Corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that comes not
to paſs for any power of the perſon injured in puniſhing (for they could
not puniſh any thing the more with the conſent of the offended perſon)
but becauſe the Law of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior hath not granted unto them that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
yea, hath expreſly denied it: which ſhould likewiſe be underſtood
concerning Kings being compared with God, in thoſe Crimes which the Divine
Law hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded indiſpenſably to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Theſe things make for this, that it may appear, that God alſo
being offended with us, is not properly a Creditor in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for he that
affirms that, relies either on that Right which proceeds from the things
themſelves, or that Rght which is conſtituted. We have ſufficiently
ſhewed, as I think, That the offended perſon is not a Creditor in the
puniſhment, by that Right which proceeds from the things themſelves. But a
conſtituted Right, not whereby pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but whereby ſuch a credit of
puniſhment may be introduced, is neither <pb n="69" facs="tcp:106819:39"/>alledged, nor if
it be alledged, can it be proved: neither can any reaſon be given, why it
ſhould have been ſo appointed. Some body will perhaps object, <hi>That God
forgiving the puniſhment of ſinners, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where compared with a
Creditor giving up his own Right, as</hi> Matth. 18.35. But as we ſhewed
above, Compariſon doth not require that things ſhould agree <hi>genere
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximo</hi> in their next kind, but is contented with any ſimilitude: So
Chriſt <hi>waſhing his Diſciples feet,</hi> gave an Example to his
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that as he did, they ſhould alſo do; that is, that they
ſhould ſerve one another. But the reſemblance of God forgiving ſins,
and of a Creditor's yielding up his own Right, is greater than the
reſemblance of the ſame God forgiving ſins, and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended perſon
forgiving offences, concerning which reſemblance we juſt now
diſcourſed. For the Acts of God and the Creditor's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, not only in the
moving Cauſe, which is Bounty, and the Effect, which is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeing from Miſery or Trouble, but in
that alſo that in both ſome right goes before in God to puniſh, in the
Creditor to require the Debt, and on both ſides there is a certain
Diſſolution of the Obligation that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; though in the Obligation it
ſelf, as <pb n="70" facs="tcp:106819:40"/>alſo in the Diſſolution, there is
ſomething unlike which, though that Example doth not properly belong to the
thing, to which it is brought, cannot wrong the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or Parable.</p>
            <p>This may be the Third Aſſertion: <hi>The right of puniſhing in
a Governour, is not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the right of abſolute Lordſhip, or the right of
the thing credited.</hi> This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, firſt, from the End, which uſeth
beſt to diſtinguiſh Faculties: For the right of abſolute Lordſhip, as
alſo the right of the thing credited, is procured for his ſake that hath
that power or right; but the power of puniſhing is not for the ſake of the
puniſher, but for the ſake of ſome Community; for all puniſhment hath
the common good propoſed, to wit, the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Order and Example;
ſo than it hath not the nature of being deſirable, but from this end;
whereas the power of Lordſhip, and of the thing credited, are of
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſirable. In this ſenſe God ſaith, That <hi>he delights
not in the puniſhment of them that are puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, It is never contrary to Juſtice to give up the right of
Lordſhip, or of the thing credited; for this is the nature of Property, that
it is as lawful to uſe it, as <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106819:40"/>not to uſe it. But to let
ſome ſins go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed (to wit, of them that repent not) would be
unjuſt in a Governour, yea in God himſelf, as <hi>Socinus</hi>
confeſſeth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the right of puniſhing is not the ſame with the
right of Property or Credit. Moreover, no man is called juſt for that, and is
praiſed upon the account of Juſtice, becauſe he uſeth his own Property,
or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he requires the Debt. But any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and God himſelf
alſo is called therefore Juſt, and Praiſed, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of
Juſtice, becauſe he forgives not puniſhment, but exacts it ſeverely.

            <p>Again, The diverſity of Vertues ariſeth from the diverſity of
Objects. But the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereby we give up our Property, or our Debt, is
called <hi>Liberality,</hi> not <hi>Clemency:</hi> but that, whereby freedom
from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is granted, is not called <hi>Liberality,</hi> but
<hi>Clemency.</hi> Perhaps ſome man may ask, ſeeing puniſhment is ſaid
to be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Who is here the Creditor? for a Debtor can ſcarcely be
understood, where there is no Creditor.</hi> But it muſt be obſerved, that
the word <hi>debere,</hi> to owe, doth not always <pb n="72" facs="tcp:106819:41"/>ſignifie a Relation between two perſons. For oftentimes <hi>Debeo
hoc facere,</hi> I ought to do this, ſignifies no other thing; but it is
convenient that this thing ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by me, without reſpect to
another perſon. So <hi>Debeo poenam,</hi> I owe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, I am
worthy of puniſhment, and I am abſolutely obliged to ſuffer it, but not
Relatively in respect of this man, or that. Therefore it is the ſame
ſenſe in what Common-wealth, or under what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor any man ſuffers the
puniſhment of a Crime, for he ſhall be equally delivered amongſt all men;
which would not be ſo, if there were a certain Creditor, as of other things,
ſo alſo of puniſhment: For payment made to him only, not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
alſo, except by his Command, would free the Debtor. The contrary, for the
moſt part appears in Reward: for it is rightly ſaid, <hi>a Reward is owing
to him:</hi> but the certain perſon that owes it (if you lay aſide the
Poſitive Law) doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. For if any man ſay, <hi>There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Common-wealth that owes a Reward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it received a Benefit,</hi> that
man will not diſtinguiſh <hi>Favour</hi> from <hi>Reward.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
it ſelf teacheth, that thoſe men alſo are honoured with Rewards by
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:106819:41"/>who have profitted, not their own
Common-wealth in particular, but Mankind, as Inventers of things profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the common good; yea, alſo we ſee Rewards given to Counſels nobly
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, though ſucceſs hath been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thereby no profit
redounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any man. Therefore neither is there here any relation between
definite perſons, ſuch as in that kind of owing, which is
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, <hi>of mutual Exchanges.</hi>
But if any man deſires ſomething in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be given him, that is,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>analogical</hi> to a
Creditor, perhaps it will not be ſaid amiſs, that the order of things and
the publick good is in the place of a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor; the diſpenſation of which
Order and Good is permitted to the Government; for this ſeems to be
ſignified by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial Speech: It is for the Publick Good, that Crimes
ſhould be puniſhed. And hence it comes to paſs, that when in other
Cauſes the Judge exerciſeth Judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Parties, oftentimes in
the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Crimes the accuſed Perſon appears, the Accuſer appears
not; becauſe Order it ſelf, or the Publick Good, is as it were in the place
of an Accuſer: which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alſo ſeems to intimate, when it
ſaith, <pb n="74" facs="tcp:106819:42"/>
               <hi>That ſin crieth againſt the ſinner.</hi>
And where a man acts for puniſhment, he acts either as any man (as in thoſe
places where Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations lye open to all men promiſcuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) or as
appointed for this thing by the Law; which happens in thoſe places which have
Accuſers publickly conſtituted: Both of which is a certain token, that by
nature and really there is not here any definite Adverſary, and as it were a
Requirer of Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Another Queſtion follows, <hi>What is the force of that word, when

the Latin Poets ſay, that thoſe things which they ſignifie are put out of

               <hi>to give him to another
man,</hi> Acts 3.14. 25.11 and 16. All which ſignifie, that no Property or
Debt is neceſſarily ſignified by that word. Concerning the Latin words,
<hi>donandi, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donandi, remittendi,</hi> of giving, forgiving, pardoning, it
is leſs neceſſary that we ſhould be ſolicitous, becauſe they are
not extant in Holy Scripture; and yet it is eaſie to give an account of them;
for that hath happened unto thoſe words, that hath happened unto many other,
yea almoſt all that they are brought from, like things to like things.
<hi>Donare,</hi> to give, properly is to make that freely another mans, which
was his own by Property. Puniſhment therefore is not properly given; for what
is given exiſts before, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: Puniſhment was neither
before it was given, and by giving it is made not to be. But herein is the
ſimilitude, that as the Giver hath right in the thing, ſo 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106819:43"/>hath the Governor in puniſhment, but not the ſame
right, or equally free: For the right of Property (as we ſaid before) is for
the ſake of the Owner; but the right of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for the ſake of the
Common Good; the diſpenſation whereof, as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common things, belongs
to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. The ſecond Agreement is in this, that both in Donation the
right of the Giver, and in granting freedom from Puniſhment, the right that
was the Governor's to puniſh, is taken away. The third is, That both Donation
and Granting of freedom from Puniſhment, proceeds from the ſame Fountain of
Bounty, and profits another. Neither only here, but alſo elſewhere often
the word <hi>giving</hi> is tranſlated to thoſe things in which Lordly
Power hath no place: So a man is ſaid <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari,</hi> to be gifted by a
Magiſtrate, <hi>Civitate,</hi> with the Priviledges of the City,
<hi>vacatione,</hi> with vacation, <hi>honore,</hi> with honour,
<hi>proemio,</hi> with Reward. So <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, <hi>moram
do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare,</hi> to give delay, for <hi>auferre moram,</hi> to take away delay for
the ſake of a man: So we are ſaid to give our time to others. But
<hi>remittere</hi> ſignifies originally, as the Greek word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to remove from
himſelf;</hi> ſo a Tree lets go the Bark, <hi>remittit librum,</hi> 
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:106819:44"/>a Horſman lets go the Bridle; ſo the Ears are remitted,
<hi>aures remittuntur,</hi> and by tranſlation, <hi>custodia,</hi> cuſtody,
<hi>diſciplina,</hi> diſcipline, <hi>animus,</hi> the mind: and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places <hi>remitti</hi> and <hi>intendi</hi> are oppoſite. Hence the Debt is
ſaid <hi>remitti,</hi> when there is no account made of it; and ſo
Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither is that word applied to Puniſhment for Debt, nor to
Debt for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; but to both for another thing, in which thoſe agree
with one another. It may be added, that in ſome ſenſe it may be ſaid
that Puniſhment is owing to a man; not properly, becauſe no man here is
really a Creditor, but for ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance: For, becauſe, as the
Creditor hath power of exacting the Debt that is due to him, ſo the Governor
hath power of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, and the Accuſer of requiring Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:
Therefore ſometimes we are ſaid catachreſtically to owe Puniſhment,
either to a Governor, as to God, or to an Accuſer, as to the Devil; though
neither is the Devil injured if Puniſhment is not inflicted on a man, neither
doth it conſiſt with the Juſtice of God to remit <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
infinitely any kind of Puniſhment; neither of which can have place in real
Creditors.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of what manner is the Act of God in this Buſineſs,
and it is ſhewed that it is a Relaxation of the Law, or
Diſpenſation.</head>
            <p>THE Part which God undertakes in this Buſineſs, having been
examined, it will be eaſie to give ſome Name to the Act it ſelf. And
firſt, becauſe God is here to be looked upon, as we have proved, as a
Governor, it follows that this Act is an Act of Juriſdiction generally ſo
called. Whence it follows, that the Diſcourſe is not here of Acceptilation,
taking a Debt for paid, as <hi>Socinus</hi> thinks, for that is not an Act of
Juriſdiction. That its own <hi>Genus</hi> may be more nearly attributed unto
this Act, the Act it ſelf may be conſidered, either with relation to the
Divine Sanction, or as Modern Lawyers ſpeak, the Penal Law, or without that
relation; which we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore add, becauſe, though no Law had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106819:45"/>Puniſhment, yet naturally the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Act it ſelf,
whether having an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>al
pravity from the unchangable nature of the thing, or alſo extrinſical for
the contrary Command of God for that very Cauſe deſerves ſome
Puniſhment, and that a heavy one; that is, it was juſt, that man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
ſinner, ſhould be puniſhed: If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it thus, the Act of God, of
which we treat, will be the Puniſhment of one, to procure freedom from
puniſhment to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; concerning the Juſtice of which. Act we ſhall
preſently diſcourſe. But if fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, we look back to the Sanction,
or the Penal Act, the Act it ſelf will be a way to Indulgence, or a
Moderation of the ſame Law, which Indulgence at this day we call
Diſpenſation, which may be defined an Act of a Superior, whereby the
Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a ſtanding Law about certain Perſons or Things, is taken
away. This is the Sanction; <hi>Man eating of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, ſhall
ſurely dye,</hi> Gen. 2.17. where, by one kind of ſin every kind of ſin
is ſignified, as the ſame Law expreſſeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more clearly
explained; <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all the Precepts of the
Law,</hi> Dur. 27.26. Gal. 3.10. But by the word <hi>Death</hi> and
<hi>Curſe</hi> in theſe places, <pb n="81" facs="tcp:106819:45"/>we underſtand chiefly
<hi>Eternal Death.</hi> Therefore it is the ſame ſenſe, as if the Law had
been expreſſed after this manner; <hi>Let every man ſinning bear the
Puniſhment of Eternal Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore there is not here the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Law; for if God
ſhould have executed the Law, no ſinner could have been ſaved from the
Puniſhment of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death. <hi>But now we know that there is no
Condemnation to them that believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are delivered from
Death,</hi> Rom. 8.2. Gal. 3.31. Moreover, this act is not an Abrogation of the
Law; for a Law, that is abrogated, hath no power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But Unbelievers
are yet ſubject to the ſame Law: Therefore it is writtten, that <hi>the
wrath of God abides <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

believe not,</hi> Joh. 3.36. and that <hi>the wrath of God comes upon them to
the uttermoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. Alſo the Interpretation of
the Law is not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>according to
Moderation,</hi> for that Interpretation ſhews, that ſome Fact or Perſon
hath not been comprehended under the Obligation of the Law; as the Works of
Religion and Mercy were never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the forbidding of <hi>working
on the Sabbath,</hi> Matth. 12.5. and 6. <hi>But <pb n="82" facs="tcp:106819:46"/>all
men</hi> (as having been ſhut up under ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22.) yea thoſe alſo that are delivered, <hi>by nature,</hi>
or of themſelves, <hi>are the Sons of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. that is, they
were obliged to the Sanction of the Law; therefore the Obligation is not
declared to be none: But this is the buſineſs, that that Obligation which
was, may be taken away; that is, that there may be a Relaxation or
Diſpenſation of the Law.</p>
            <p>Here it may be asked, <hi>Whether that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law is relaxable?</hi>
For there are ſome Laws unrelaxable, either abſolutely or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Conditition, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
unrelaxable, are thoſe, of which the oppoſite contains an immutable
pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it ſelf, by reaſon of the nature of the thing it ſelf: As for
Example, the Law, which forbids <hi>Perjury,</hi> and <hi>bearing falſe
Witneſs againſt a Neighbour;</hi> for as we ſay, <hi>that God cannot
lie,</hi> Hebr. 6.18. or <hi>deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. ſo
no leſs rightly ſhall we ſay, <hi>That God cannot do, or approve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Actions, or grant a power to do them.</hi> But Laws unrelaxable
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>upon Suppoſition,</hi> are
thoſe that are made by a definite Decree, which the Scripture calls
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unchanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs,</hi> or
<hi>unrepentableneſs of Will,</hi> ſuch as is <pb n="83" facs="tcp:106819:46"/>the Law
of damning them, that are not willing to believe in Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi>
3.18. but all Poſitive Laws are abſolutely relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: neither ſhould men
fly to an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical neceſſity by a definite Decree, when there is no
ſign appearing of ſuch a Decree. But that ſome are affraid, leſt if we
grant that, we do an injury to God, as if we made him mutable; in that they are
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived: for the Law is not ſomething Internal in God, or the very
Will of God, but a certain Effect of his Will. But it is very certain, that the
Effects of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will are mutable; neither doth God in promulgating a
Poſitive Law, which he would at ſometime relax, ſignifie that he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
another thing than he really willeth. For God ſeriouſly ſheweth, that he
wills that the Law ſhould be ratified, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, yet retaining the power
of relaxing, which is joyned to Poſitive Law of its own nature, neither can
it be underſtood by any ſign to be abdicated of God. Verily it is another
thing, if there adhere to a Po-Poſitive Law, either an Oath or Promiſe,
both of which are obſerved, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.18. for an Oath is a ſign of
the immutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the thing to which it is added, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.11.
110.4. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.11. 6.17. 7.21. <pb n="84" facs="tcp:106819:47"/>And a Promiſe
gives power to a Party, which cannot without injury be taken from it: Therefore
though to promiſe is free, yet there is not a freedom to break Promiſes;
therefore that ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to thoſe things that have immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pravity in themſelves. Therefore God cannot do this, who is therefore called
<hi>faithful,</hi> becauſe he keeps his Promiſes, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi>
5.24. Therefore let us ſee whether there is in the ſaid Penal Law any thing
that utterly diſallows Relaxation.</p>
            <p>And firſt, it may be objected, <hi>That it is just naturally, that
the Guilty themſelves be puniſhed with ſuch a puniſhment as is
anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Crime: and therefore that it is not ſubject to
Free-will, nor is relaxable.</hi> That this Objection may be anſwered, it
muſt be known that unjuſt doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of any denial of juſt, no not
at that very time when the ſame Circumſtances are put: for as it doth not
follow, if a King ſhould be called Liberal, who gave to ſome Man a
thouſand Talents, that he ſhould therefore not be Liberal if he gave them
not; ſo it is not perpetual, that that which is performed juſtly, cannot be
omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but unjuſtly. Now a thing is called natural, as in Phyſicks, ſo
in Morals, either <pb n="85" facs="tcp:106819:47"/>properly, or leſs properly. Natural in
Phyſicks properly, is that which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily coheres to the Eſſence
of every thing; as for a living Creature to have ſenſe: but leſs properly
that which is convenient, and as it were fitted for any Nature; as for a man to
uſe his right hand. So then in Morals there are ſome things properly
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, which follow neceſſarily from the relation of the things unto
rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as that Perjury is unlawful; but ſome improperly, as that
a Son ſucceeds the Father. Therefore that he that hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, deſerves
Puniſhment, and therefore is puniſhable, this follows neceſſarily from
the relation of the ſin and ſinner to the Superior, and it is properly
natural. But that any ſinner ſhould be puniſhed with ſuch a
Puniſhment as is anſwerable to the Fault, is not neceſlary ſimply, and
univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally. Neither is it properly natural, but agreeable enough unto
Nature; whence it follows, that nothing hinders why the Law commanding this
ſame thing ſhould not be relaxable. The ſign of a definite Decree or
Irrevocability, appears not in that Law, of which we Diſcourſe; neither is
it a promiſing Law; therefore none of thoſe things hinder a Relaxation; for
it <pb n="86" facs="tcp:106819:48"/>ſhould not be admitted, that a threatning ſhould be
equallized to a Promiſe: for by a Promiſe ſome right is acquired to him,
to whom the Promiſe was made. But by threatning, only the merit of
Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſinner, and the right of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing in the Threatner,
are more openly declared. Neither is it to be feared, leaſt ſomething be
detracted from the Veracity of God, if he doth not fulfil all his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings:
for it muſt be underſtood, that all threatnings that have not with them a
ſign of Irrevocability by their own nature, do dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh nothing of the
right of the Threatner to relax, as before was declared: and it appears
manifeſtly by the Example of the Divine Clemency towards the
<hi>Ninevites.</hi> It muſt not be here omitted, that the ancient
Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers by Natural Light judged, that no matter was more relaxable than
Penal Law. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that

               <hi>That
which is called moderate Juſtice, comfortably interpreting the auſtere
voice of the Laws, ſeems unto me an innocent pretence of the true and free
Graces: but correcting Justice in mutual Exchanges, wholly ſhuns the nature
of the Graces. But that which conſiſts in Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doth not abhor
the meek and courteous face of the Graces.</hi> It appears by theſe things,
which hitherto have been ſaid, that that Poſitive and Penal Law of God was
diſpenſable. But this hinders not, but that there were certain Reaſons,
which might diſſwade (that I may ſtammer after hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane manner) this
Relaxation. And theſe may be taken either from the nature of all Laws, or
from the proper matter of the Law. It is common to all Laws, that by relaxing
ſomething ſeems to be taken away from the Anthority of a Law. It is a
property of this Law, that though that Law, as we ſaid, hath not an
inflexible Rectitude, yet it is very agreeable to the Nature and Order of
things: from which things it follows, That the Law was not to be wholly
unrelaxable, but not eaſily, nor for a light Cauſe. And the only
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>infinitely wiſe
Lawgiver</hi> did <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106819:49"/>according to that. For he had a very
weighty Cauſe, when Mankind fell into ſin, to relax the Law; becauſe if
all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had been to be given up to Eternal Death, two very beautiful
things had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly periſhed out of the World; on Mens part Religion towards
God, on God's part the Teſtimony of his ſpecial Bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men.
Neither did God, in relaxing the Law, obſerve Cauſes only, and that very
weighty ones, but alſo did ſet a ſingular Bounds to the Relaxation,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which there will be a fitter place to Diſcourſe afterwards.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Whether it is unjuſt that Chriſt ſhould be
puniſhed for our ſins? And it is ſhewed that it is not unjuſt.</head>
            <p>THE Arguments whereby <hi>Socinus</hi> goes about to diſprove this
Doctrine, having not been placed by him in a right enough Order, ſeems to us
that they ought to be digeſted in this manner: That the firſt rank be of
thoſe Reaſonings, which gather that <hi>That which we defend to have been
performed, is unjuſt.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of thoſe <hi>that deny there was
cauſe for ſo doing.</hi> The third, of thoſe <hi>which deny that God did
that which we aſſert.</hi> For if the thing it ſelf hath
Unrighteouſneſs in it, in vain is the Cauſe thereof ſought for,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be no reaſonable Cauſe of that which is unjuſt: In
vain alſo is it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed, Whether it hath been? becauſe no unjuſt
thing can be done by God. Alſo <pb n="90" facs="tcp:106819:50"/>the Examination of the
Cauſe, becauſe by nature it goes before the Queſtion of the Fact,
ſhould alſo firſt be handled: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may come to the
Queſtion of Juſt and Unjuſt, firſt, theſe things are to be
ſeparated, <hi>Whether it was juſt that Chirſt ſhould be puniſhed for
our ſins? And if that could any thing Conduce to obtain a pardon for us?</hi>
For this latter muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the ſecond rank, that diſputes of
the Cauſe of the Fact: but it belongs not properly to this firſt. For
though ſuch a Cauſe of Puniſhment had not been, it would not thence
follow, that ſome Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is contained in the Puniſhment. But it ſeems
that an Injury may be ſought, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Matter it ſelf, that is, in
the very heavy Afflictions and Death compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Innocency of him who
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thoſe things; or in the Form, that is, in the Puniſhment
compared with other mens Sins, as the meritorious Cauſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we
ſhall ſhew, that there is Injury in neither.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, <hi>Socinus</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>That it is not
unjuſt that Chriſt, moſt Innocent, ſhould ſuffer from God very heavy
Puniſhments, and Death it ſelf that hence no help can come to his
Cauſe.</hi> And the thing it ſelf demonſtrates <pb n="91" facs="tcp:106819:50"/>the
ſame very evidently: For Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory ſhews, that <hi>Christ
ſuffered very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous things,</hi> and <hi>that he died alſo.</hi> The
Scripture no leſs evidently ſays, that <hi>God did this very thing.</hi>
But without blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the Sacred Deity, it cannot be denied, that God doth
nothing unjuſtly. Therefore paſſing over to the other part, I affirm,
<hi>That it is not ſimply unjuſt, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of puniſhment,
that a man ſhould ſuffer for other mens ſins.</hi> When I ſay
<hi>unjuſt,</hi> it is manifeſt that I ſpeak of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,</hi>
which riſeth out of things, not which riſeth out of Poſitive Law, as
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Divine Liberty cannot be diminiſhed. I prove this that I ſaid;
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. and 34.7. <hi>God viſits the Iniquities of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon the Sons, Nephews, and Nephews Children. Our Fathers ſinned, and we bear
their puniſhment,</hi> Lam. 5.7. For the Fact of <hi>Cham, Canaan</hi> is
ſubjected to a Curſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.25. For the Fact of <hi>Saul,</hi>
his Sons and Nephews were hanged, God appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
21.8,14. For the Fact of <hi>David</hi> 70000 periſh, and <hi>David</hi>
cries out, <hi>I have ſinned, and done wickedly, but what have theſe
ſheep done?</hi> 2 Sam. 24.15. and 17. So for the Fact of <hi>Achan</hi> his
Sons are puniſhed, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7.24. and for the <pb n="92" facs="tcp:106819:51"/>Fact
of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> his Poſterity, 1 <hi>King</hi> 14. Theſe places
manifeſtly ſhew that ſome are puniſhed by God for other mens ſins. He
that hath time, may ſee <hi>Chryſoſtom Homil.</hi> 29. on <hi>Gen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinus</hi> objects that in <hi>Ezechiel, The Soul that hath
ſinned, it ſhall die; The Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father,
neither ſhall the Father bear the Iniquity of the Son.</hi> But in theſe
words God teacheth not what he muſt neceſſarily do, but what he hath
decreed freely to do. Therefore it doth no more follow hence, that it is wholly
unjuſt, that the Son ſhould bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny puniſhment of his Father's fault,
than that it is unjuſt that a ſinner ſhould die. The place it ſelf
proves, That God doth not here diſcourſe of a perpetual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Law,
but of the ordinary Courſe of his Providence, which he profeſſeth he will
after that time uſe towards the Jews, that he may break off all occaſions
of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.</p>
            <p>Neither is that more to the purpoſe that is written <hi>Deut.</hi>
24.16. <hi>Let not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be put to death for the Sons, nor the Sons for
the Fathers; but let every man be put to death for his own ſin.</hi> Of which
alſo <pb n="93" facs="tcp:106819:51"/>there is mention made 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.6. for
this Law is in part Poſitive, whereunto God is not tied, as having no where
made that Law to himſelf; neither indeed can he be tied to any Law. Alſo
the diverſity of the Reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe the power of Men is
narrower than that of God; which ſhall be more clearly explained afterwards;
though now alſo I may intimate, that the abuſe of Power is feared in men,
but it is not feared in God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinus</hi> replies, <hi>That no where in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the
Innocent are found puniſhed for the ſins of the Guilty.</hi> But this Reply
is not to the purpoſe: For ſeeing we read that ſome were puniſhed, not
only for their own ſins, (in reſpect whereof they were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) but alſo
for other mens ſins, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that they were alſo puniſhed, as they
were not guilty. But if a man may in part be puniſhed as he is not guilty,
the nature of the thing doth not hinder, but that he may be puniſhed in the
whole; for the right of the parts and the whole is the ſame: Add alſo that
the Poſterity of <hi>Saul</hi> were wholly innocent, as to that ſin, for
which they were puniſhed. But if a man may be puniſhed in a reſpect,
wherein he is innocent, he may alſo be puniſhed <pb n="94" facs="tcp:106819:52"/>being
innocent. And, if a man rihtly conſider, Innocence hindereth not
puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than Affliction; yea it hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that at all, but for
this. Therefore the diſtinction of Guilty and Innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the
Queſtion, <hi>Whether any man may be juſtly Afflicted:</hi> but not to
this, <hi>Whether his Affliction may have the force of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> For
it being granted, That Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a man's own Sin, is not of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Puniſhment, it being alſo granted, that the Innocent may be afflicted,
(as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> confeſſeth God may do for a while) no Reaſon verily
can be given, why by the very nature of things (for here we treat not of
Poſitive Law) it ſhould be unjuſt that an innocent Perſon ſhould be
puniſhed for another man's Fault with ſuch Affliction, eſpecially if he
hath of his own accord obliged himſelf to ſuch a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hath
power in himſelf to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it: which ſhall be handled after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinus</hi> urgeth, <hi>That at leaſt between the Guilty, and
him that is puniſhed, there ought to be ſome Conjunction;</hi> which he
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges between Father and Son, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and us, he doth not
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It might be ſaid here, that man is <pb n="95" facs="tcp:106819:52"/>not
without relation to man, that there is a Natural Kindred and Conſanguinity
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men, becauſe Chriſt took upon him our Fleſh. But another much
greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction between Chriſt and us was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by God; for he was
appointed of God, that he ſhould be the Head of the Body of which we are
Members. And here it muſt obſerved, that <hi>Socinus</hi> did erroneouſly
confine to the Fleſh, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction which is ſufficient for the laying
Puniſhment upon one for the ſins of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe here the Myſtical
Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath no leſs power; which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt in the Example of a
King and People.</p>
            <p>There was cited above the Hiſtory of the People of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> puniſhed for the ſin of <hi>David:</hi> Concerning which
thing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Author of <hi>Queſtions and Anſwers to the Orthodox
which are carried about with the Name of</hi> Juſtinus, diſcourſing
wiſely, ſaid thus; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106819:53"/>
               <hi>As a man conſiſts of a Soul and Body, ſo a
Kingdom conſiſts of the King and People; and as a man, having ſinned a
ſin with his hand, if he be ſtruck upon the back, he that ſtruck him doth
no injuſtice; ſo God doth no injuſtice in puniſhing the People for the
Faults of their Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length <hi>Socinus</hi> comes to this, that he ſaith, <hi>That
at leaſt this is not found in the Scripture, that an Innocent Perſon was
puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thoſe Faults, for which the Guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf was
not puniſhed</hi> But this alſo is not to the purpoſe: For becauſe it
is not of it ſelf and univerſally unjuſt to grant Impunity to a guilty
Perſon, (which <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> confeſſeth) neither is it unjuſt to
puniſh a man for another man's ſins; there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be injuſtice in
theſe, no not when they are joyned together. Yea, the Scripture makes
manifeſt that that very thing is not unjuſt, by the Example of
<hi>Achab,</hi> who received the impunity of his ſins, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof was required of his Son and Poſterity, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.29. 2
<hi>Kings</hi> 8, 9, and 10. But this ſhall be more accurately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined when
we ſhall come to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>What Cauſe moved God that he
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Chriſt for our ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:106819:53"/>Therefore the Sacred Writings do not at all
ſtand on <hi>Socinus</hi> his ſide, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that God did that, which
<hi>Socinus</hi> unjuſtly accuſeth of unjuſtice. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he any
great Defence from right Reaſon, which it is wonderful that he ſo often
doth boaſt of, but ſhews it no where. But that all this Errour may be taken
away, it muſt be obſerved, that it is eſſential to puniſhment that it
ſhould be inflicted for ſin; but it is not eſſential to it, that it
ſhould be inflicted upon him, who ſinned: and that is manifeſt by the
ſimilitude of <hi>Reward, Favour,</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> For often Reward
uſeth to be conferred upon the Children or Kindred of a well-deſerving
Perſon, and Favour on them that are near a-kin to him that beſtowed the
benefit, and revenge on the Friends of him that offended: neither do they upon
that account ceaſe to be what they are, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Favour,</hi> and
<hi>Revenge.</hi> To the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation hereof this all conduceth, That if it
were againſt the nature of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then this very thing ſhould not
be called unjuſt, but impoſſible. But God forbid the Son to be puniſhed
by men for the Fathers ſin, but they are not forbidden things impoſſible.
Moreover Unjuſtice <pb n="98" facs="tcp:106819:54"/>properly happeneth not to a Relation
(ſuch as Puniſhment is) but to the Action it ſelf, ſuch as is the
matter of Puniſhment. And here it is neceſſary that the true dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
ſhould be ſought, Why it ſhould not be equally free to all men to
puniſh a man for another mans ſins, as to beſtow a Reward or Favour for
another man's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Benefit: For an act in which is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Favour is a
benevolent act, which in its own nature is free to all; but the act in which
Puniſhment is, is a hurtful act, which is neither granted to all, nor upon
all. Wherefore, that a Puniſhment may be juſt, it is required, that the
Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal act it ſelf ſhould be in the power of the Puniſher: which
happeneth three ways; either by the antecedent right of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher, or by
a juſt and valid conſent of him whoſe Puniſhment is the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or by the Crime of the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. When by theſe ways the act is made
lawful, nothing interpoſeth, but that it may be ordained for the puniſhment
of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man's ſin, provided there be ſome Conjunction between him that
ſinned, and the Party to be puniſhed. And this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is either
Natural, as between a Father and a Son; or Myſtical, as between 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106819:54"/>King and People; or Voluntary, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Guilty
Perſon and the Surety. <hi>Socinus</hi> appeals to the Judgment of all
Nations. But as to God, the Philoſophers doubted not that the ſins of the
Parents were puniſhed by him in the Children. Which <hi>Plutarch</hi>

adviſeth that puniſhment ſhould be ſuffered, for evil Deeds. L. ſi

brings this reaſon, why the ſame power is not in Corporal Puniſhments,
becauſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney may be made another mans, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being paid for
another by a ſhort fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the hand, it may ſeem given to the

a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man's; but this is ſaid more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilely than truly: For that
Reaſon makes ſomething for the procuring Deliverance to the Guilty
Perſon. But that reaſon doth not make that the Puniſhment which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath deſerved, ſhould be inflicted on another: for if that were of force,
often the Reward of a well-deſerving Perſon could not be paid to a Perſon
joyned with him; to wit, becauſe the thing in which the Reward ſhould
conſiſt, could not be made his that deſerved it, either becauſe he was

the Sons of well-deſerving Perſons upon the <pb n="102" facs="tcp:106819:56"/>Publick
Charge. The <hi>Romans</hi> granted unto the Sons of the ancient Soldiers the
priviledges of Corporals: They ſuffered neither the Nephews, nor the Sons of
the Nephews of the moſt Perfect (as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them) to be ſubject to
Examinations. We read in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, that
the Memory of Parents hath been of advantage to Children to ſave them from
Puniſhment: but the Education, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, or Impunity of Children cannot be
made the Education, Priviledge or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity of the dead Parents. Yea, if it
were true that <hi>Socinus</hi> ſays, then the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment could not be
exacted of the Surety, not being willing that the Guilty Perſon, being
abſent by chance, ſhould be freed from the Obligation of a Pecuniary
puniſhment. Therefore as touching this Queſtion, this is not the true
difference between Pecuniary and Corporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We ſhall mention the
truer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. But this I moſt wonder at, that <hi>Socinus</hi> ſays;
<hi>That it's proved by the Laws and Cuſtoms of all Nations and Ages, that a
Corporal Puniſhment, that one oweth, cannot be paid by another.</hi> For
verily, amongſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> of old, for the Fault of one man his
Kindred periſhed, as witneſſes <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus.</hi> 
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:106819:56"/>Amongſt the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the Heads of thoſe
were Condemned that were of the ſame Blood with the Traytors, as
<hi>Curtius</hi> tells. In the Cities of <hi>Grecia</hi> it was a Cuſtom,
that, together with the Tyrants, the Children of the Tyrants were ſlain, as
<hi>Halicarnaſſoeus</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves. Indeed, theſe
things are not commendable, but yet they prove that that Aſſertion,
concerning the Conſent of all Nations, is not in all reſpects true. And in
theſe Examples the Conjunction of Perſons only, ſeemed to ſuffice for
Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any Conſent: which <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaſſoeus</hi>
obſerves to have been rejected by the <hi>Romans.</hi> But where any
Conſent went before, I dare almoſt be bold to ſay, that there was none of
all thoſe, whom we call <hi>Pagans,</hi> that judged it an unjuſt thing for
one man to be puniſhed for another man's Fault. The power of killing
<hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> ſhews this, which was uſual to the moſt courteous
People. The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> of old killed Two hundred and fifty
Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells. The <hi>Romans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed three
hundred <hi>Volſcians.</hi> They threw down the <hi>Tarentines</hi> from the
<hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock, as is mentioned in <hi>Livius.</hi> There are extant
the like Examples of <hi>Goths, Danes</hi> 
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:106819:57"/>and
<hi>Engliſh-men:</hi> And as very Learned men have rightly obſerved, it was
judged righteous ſo to do. So alſo in Capital Judgments the Pledges were
uſually ſlain, if the Guilty Perſons did not preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
whence by the <hi>Grecians</hi> they were called

it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſufficiently both from other places, and alſo from the noble
Hiſtory of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Pythias.</hi> Neither is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that they ſo judged; for, becauſe they believed that every man had no

it was clearly the Conſequence that they believed Life could be ſtrongly
obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no leſs than other things; for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being preſuppoſed, it
was neceſſary the latter alſo ſhould be granted. And verily, if any man
examine this Buſineſs with requiſite diligence, he will find a true
difference why a man is leſs obliged by conſent to Coporal, than Pecuniary
Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; that is, that he that conſents hath not equal power over Body
and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Neither yet do I aſſent unto the Modern Lawyers approving this
by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106819:57"/>Anſwer of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpianus,</hi> who ſaid,
<hi>That no man ſeems Lord of his own Members.</hi> L. liber homo d. ad Legem
Aquil. For he takes the word <hi>Lord</hi> ſtrictly, according to the uſe
of Civil Law, as it is oppoſed to a Servant, becauſe the <hi>Aquilian</hi>
Law ſpeaks ſtrictly of a Servant, he denies that the direct Action that is
anſwerable to the words of the Law, can be accommodated to a Free-man
wounded: yet ſo that by the likeneſs of Reſpects he thinks an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Action ſhould be given. And that I may truly ſay what I think, though I
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much admire the Equity of the <hi>Romans</hi> in moderating this
Extenſion of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I cannot be perſwaded to believe that it
was a thing by them ſuppoſed wholly, and of it ſelf unjuſt, that one
man ſhould be corporally puniſhed for the Fault of another. Neither am I
therefore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe Suretiſhips were by them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden under capital
puniſhment: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things uſe to be forbidden, not becauſe they are
judged altogether unjuſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are dangerous, as all
Suretiſhips of Women, and of others alſo for a Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this therefore
belonged to Civil Law, which becauſe it failed in Foreign People, therefore
it was otherways obſerved in <pb n="106" facs="tcp:106819:58"/>Hoſtages by the
<hi>Romans</hi> themſelves. Yea, ſo long a time afterwards Chriſtian
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors appointed that the Jaylor, when the guilty Perſon eſcaped through

ſince, noble Maſters of Law have taught that this Rule, <hi>That no man
ſhould oblige himſelf to Capital Puniſhment, ceaſeth, if Law or
Cuſtom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as touching thoſe Puniſhments which reſpect not any
Conſent, but only the Conjunction of Perſons, though the <hi>Roman</hi>
Laws forbid a Son to be the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of his Father's Puniſhment, or to
be marked with any Blot for his Father's Crime, yet
<hi>Halicurnaſſaeus</hi> obſerves, that this very thing obtain'd not from
the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but from that time, in which <hi>Sp. Caſſius</hi> was
condemned of Tyranny. Wherefore neither the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves
thought that this Power deſcended from a certain perpetual and immutable Rule
of Juſtice. Whereas the Emperours <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi>
would ſeem to grant Life to the Sons of them that had committed Treaſon,
not of the Neceſſity of the Law, but of their Imperial Lenity, when
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106819:58"/>as they themſelves ſpeak, they ought to

otherways, is taken away from the Sons of Rebels, that Infamy is branded upon
them, that they are not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attain to Preferments or Corporations.
Afterwards it is added; <hi>May they be ſuch, that unto them, being
oppreſſed with perpetual want, Death may be a Comfort, and Life a
Puniſhment.</hi> Excluſion from Preferments about the Children of them that
had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt the Commonwealth, was a long time uſed by the
<hi>Romans</hi> from the times of <hi>Sylla.</hi> But that Sons ſhould
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer want for the Crimes of their Parents, <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays it is an
ancient thing, and of all Cities; and namely he adds, that the Children of
<hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſuffered want: which are only therefore brought, that
it may appear that there was not that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <pb n="108" facs="tcp:106819:59"/>of
Nations, which <hi>Socinus</hi> brings in himſelf: and that, the
<hi>Romans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whoſe Equity was moſt conſpicuous
amongſt all People, did not regard that difference in puniſhment, that
Money may be made another man's, but Corporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment may not: For
neither the Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Children, or Infamy, or their Excluſion from
Preferment, could be made the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Parents, their Infamy, or their
Excluſion from Preferments, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance by a certain Fiction, which
eſteems the Father and Children as if they were one and the ſame man.
Alſo I wonder at that which <hi>Socinus</hi> pronounceth of the Fact of
<hi>Zaleucus,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory is in <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> and
<hi>Aelianus,</hi> that he ſaith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e hath a very ill report, and his name is reckoned amongſt
headſtrong and raſh Princes and Judges of People; verily all Antiquity,
both for wiſe Laws, and alſo chiefly upon the account of that Fact,
commended <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus;</hi> as alſo it appears by theſe Writers, that I
mentioned, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others; and I think that no other ancient
Writer judgeth otherways of that Fact. The Sentence of <hi>Valerius
Maximus</hi> is in the eyes of all men. Alſo there is nothing ſtronger than
thoſe Examples of Juſtice, <pb n="109" facs="tcp:106819:59"/>
               <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> when he
had guarded the City of the <hi>Locrenſes</hi> with very wholſom and
profitable Laws, when his Son being Condemned for the Crime of Adultery,
according to the Law appointed by him, ſhould have wanted both his Eyes, and
the whole City, in reſpect to the Father, forgave the young man the
neceſſity of the Puniſhment, for ſometime he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented not. At
length, being overcome by the Prayers of the People, firſt having plucked out
his own Eye, and then his Sons, he reſerved the uſe of ſeeing to both. So
he rendered unto the Law, the due meaſure of Puniſhment, by a wonderful
moderation of Juſtice, having divided himſelf between a merciful Father,
and a juſt Law-giver. And verily, if a man had a free power, as of Living in
Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſo in plucking out his own Eye, nothing could be found more
praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than that Fact of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> eſpecially when the
preciſe Obligation of the Law ceaſed, either for his Principality, or for
the Peoples Conſent. Therefore <hi>Zaleucus</hi> erred, as almoſt all
Pagans, that he claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a greater power over his own Body than was due. But
that Fact ſo much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, gives Teſtimony againſt that 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106819:60"/>Knowledge that <hi>Socinus</hi> thinks is imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in
the minds of men, that no man can take upon himſelf the puniſhment of
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's Fault.</p>
            <p>That we may conclude this Queſtion, this is not enquired,
<hi>Whether it is lawful for any Judge to inflict upon any man any
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of another man's Crime?</hi> For the Law of Superiour Judges
takes away this power from the Inferiour. Neither is this enquired, <hi>Whether
this be lawful to the higheſt Power among men, in any puniſhment, and over
any man?</hi> for ſometimes either the Law of God, or natural Reaſon
hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth. But this properly is enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>Whether the Act, that is
in the power of the Superiour, may without conſideration of another man's
Crime, be ordained by that Superiour for the puniſhment of another man's
Crime.</hi> The Scripture denies this to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, which ſhews that God
did this. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture denies, becauſe it is not proved to forbid; the Conſent
of Nations openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And that the thing may be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more naked
before the Eyes, who judges Decimation that was uſual in the <hi>Roman</hi>
Legions to be unjuſt, when he that offended, and could have been pardoned no
leſs than another, is puniſhed not for <pb n="111" facs="tcp:106819:60"/>his own Fault
only, but for the Fault of all the other? Who judgeth it unjuſt, if, the
higheſt Power relaxing the Law, ſome man uſeful to the Common-wealth, but
deſerving Baniſhment for a Fault, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Common wealth, yet
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his own accord obliging himſelf to Baniſhment to ſatisfie the
Example? Who would judge it unjuſt, if a chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Common-wealth
denies Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Children of Rebels, otherways not unworthy, if there are
others found as fit for them? Verily there is no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice here; for in the
firſt kind of Fact, the proper fault of the Perſon puniſhed; in the
ſecond, the valid Conſent of the Party concerned; in the third, the
Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Governour permitted that to be performed, which the Governour
uſeth for puniſhment. In our Fact God hath power to puniſh Chriſt,
being Innocent, unto a Temporal Death, as <hi>Socinus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, to
wit, a Lordly Power: Chriſt alſo had by Divine Conceſſion, yea, as
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God himſelf, a Power which we have not, over his own Life and Body.
<hi>I,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>have

Injuſtice in this, That <pb n="112" facs="tcp:106819:61"/>God who hath the higheſt Power
for all things that are not of themſelves unjuſt, he himſelf being
ſubject to no Law, would uſe the Torments and Death of Chriſt, to ſhew
a weighty Example againſt the great Crimes of us all, to whom Chriſt was
very nearly joyned by Nature, Kingdom, Suretiſhip: which, how not only
juſtly but alſo wiſely, was appointed by the moſt Wiſe and moſt
Juſt God, it will appear more in the following Chapter, where we ſhall

            <head>CHAP. V. Whether there was ſufficient Cauſe, that moved God
to puniſh Chriſt for us? and it is ſhewed that there was.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinus</hi> often endeavours to prove that God was not willing
that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer puniſhment for us by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe there appears no Cauſe that God would do ſo. We need not here
uſe the Lawyers Defence, who deny that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given of all things
that were appointed by Anceſtors, though this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge may much more juſtly
be laid open to us than to them, becauſe it is not ſo difficult to men to
ſearch into the Cauſes of Human Will, becauſe of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of
Nature: but the Cauſes of the Divine Will, many times, through their very
ſublimeneſs, are hid from us. <hi>Who knoweth the mind of the Lord, who
hath been his Counſeller?</hi> Rom. 11.32. Therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106819:62"/>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Rom. 11.33.
<hi>his ways are unſearchable.</hi> It could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that often the Will
of God is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to it ſelf for a Cauſe: for theſe things being
excepted, that contain in themſelves a certain rectitude and determined to
one, which God willeth becauſe they are juſt, that is, becauſe they agree
to his Nature, in all other things that he willeth, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them juſt by
willing; ſo on whom he will, he hath <hi>mercy,</hi> and whom he will he
<hi>hardneth,</hi> Rom. 9.18. But it is not neceſſary that we ſhould fly
to thoſe things, becauſe God himſelf hath manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough declared
unto us Cauſes of his own Counſel. But it is convenient that we ſhould
ſay this only by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, that <hi>Socinus</hi> doth not rightly
require that ſuch a Cauſe ſhould be rendered, which may prove that God
could not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; for ſuch a Cauſe in theſe things that God doth
freely, is not requiſite. But he that will ſay, this Action is free, will
have <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for a Conſenter; that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>God
wanted not another poſſible way of delivering us, but there was not another
more convenient way for curing our Miſery.</hi> But alſo before
<hi>Auguſtine, Athanaſius</hi> ſaid,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:106819:62"/> 
               <hi>God
could have ſaid a word, and ſo aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Curſe, if he had not come
at all; but it behoveth to conſider that which is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to men, and not
the power of God in all things.</hi> Therefore that demand of <hi>Socinus</hi>
is ſo much the more unjuſt, becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives no Cauſes of
the Torments and Death of Chriſt, which draw any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity with them;
for Oracles and Miracles could ſuffice to ſhew us the way of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and Chriſt could without Death, and Death without Chriſt: for the
Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Death of the Prophets alſo and Apoſtles, the Life alſo
of Chriſt, could be abundantly ſufficient unto us for this uſe. Chriſt
alſo could, after a Life paſſed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently here, as <hi>Enoch</hi> or
<hi>Elias,</hi> have been tranſlated into Heaven without Death, and thence
ſhew his Majeſty to the Earth. For theſe are the Cauſes to which
<hi>Socinus</hi> aſcribes the Death of Chriſt, as appears to any man, which
are not joyned with that Effect by any neceſſity. What if it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to him to alledge Cauſes not cogent, that I may ſo ſay, but inviting and
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading, Equity ſuffers not that he ſhould <pb n="116" facs="tcp:106819:63"/>give
a harder Law to them that diſpute with him.</p>
            <p>But it will not be difficult to us to give a ſufficient Cauſe,
and that very weighty, out of the Scriptures, whether we ask this, <hi>Why God
would forgive Eternal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to us?</hi> or, <hi>Why he was not willing
otherways to forgive the ſame, but by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt?</hi> The former
hath Cauſe in his Goodneſs, which of all the Properties of God is moſt
proper to God: for every where God deſcribes himſelf chiefly by this
Attribute, that he is <hi>bountiful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> Exod. 34.7. Joſh.
4.2. 2 Chron. 30.9. Pſal. 86.4. and 14. 103.8. 111.4,5. Iſai. 55.7. Jer.
31.20. Joel 2.12. Luke 6.36. Rom. 2.4. Therefore God is forward to help man,
and make him happy: But this he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, while that horrible and eternal
Puniſhment remains. Moreover, if Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death ſhould have been inflicted
upon all men, all Religion had periſhed through Deſpair of Happineſs:
therefore there were great Cauſes of ſparing. On the other ſide, thoſe
Teſtimonies of Scripture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brought by us, which ſay that Chriſt
was for our ſins delivered up, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, died, do prove that God had
cauſe, Why he laid puniſhment on Chriſt. For <pb n="117" facs="tcp:106819:63"/>theſe
kinds of ſpeaking, as we there ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſignifie an Impulſive Cauſe.
But by theſe things that we have ſaid of the end, it may be underſtood
that there was not only a Cauſe, but alſo what the Cauſe was; to wit,
that God would not paſs by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo great ſins, without a
remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Example. But this is therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every ſin doth greatly
diſpleaſe God, and ſo much the more, how much greater it is:
<hi>Prov.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.4.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8. <hi>Hebr.</hi>
11.2. But becauſe God is active, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Creatures uſing reaſon for
that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he ſhould make his Properties more manifeſt, it is
convenient for him to teſtifie by ſome act how much ſins di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſe
him; but the act moſt agreeable to that thing is puniſhment. Hence is that
in God, which Sacred Writings call <hi>Anger,</hi> becauſe there is no other
word more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10,11. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.1. 16.22.
25.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.5,6. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. 2.8.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.16. By this
<hi>Anger</hi> God teſtifies that he is hindered from doing <hi>Good</hi> to
men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.2.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29,30. Moreover, all impunity of ſin of it ſelf hath
this, that ſins are thereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <pb n="118" facs="tcp:106819:64"/>to be of leſs
value; as on the contrary, the moſt expeditious way of driving from ſin, is
fear of puniſhment. Hence that, by bearing a former Injury, thou inviteſt a
new one, therefore Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon this account ſtirs up a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to
puniſhment. Moreover, the Cauſe of puniſhment is augmented, when any Law
is publiſhed, which threatneth puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for then the omiſſion of
puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the moſt, detracts from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Law
amongſt Subjects. Hence that Precept of the Politicians,

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to keep ſtrongly the
appointed Laws.</hi> Therefore God hath very weighty Cauſes of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
eſpecially if you pleaſe to conſider, both the magnitude and multitude of
ſins. But, becauſe amongſt all Gods Properties, the love of Mankind hath
the pre-eminence, therefore God, when he could juſtly, and was moved to
puniſh the ſins of all men with a deſerved and legal puniſhment, that
is, with Eternal Death, he would ſpare them that believe in Chriſt; But
when he was to ſpare, by making ſome or no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample againſt ſo many and
ſo great ſins, moſt wiſely he choſe that way, by which many of his
Properties ſhould be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <pb n="119" facs="tcp:106819:64"/>to wit, both
Clemency and Severity, or the hatred of Sin, and care of keeping the Law. So
<hi>Aelianus</hi> praiſing the Fact of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> mentions two
Cauſes thereof, that the young man may not be wholly blinded, and that that
which once was authorized, might not be deſtroyed;
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: of which Cauſes the one looks
thitherward, that ſomething of the Law may be changed through Clemency, and
the other, that it ſhould not be changed too much. They that have written
concerning the Relaxation of Laws, obſerve that thoſe are the beſt
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations, unto which Commutation or Compenſation is annexed, to wit,
becauſe that way very little of the Authority of the Law is deſtroyed, and
in ſome reſpect, that Reaſon which is the Cauſe of the Law, is obeyed;
as if he, that is obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a thing, be freed by paying the price;
for the ſame, and ſo much, are very near a-kin. Such Commutation is
ſometimes admitted, not only among things, but alſo ſometimes among
Perſons, providing that may be without hurt to the other party. So Fathers
are permitted to ſucceed into the Priſon of the Son, as <hi>Cimon</hi>
ſucceeded <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades,</hi> 
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:106819:65"/>and that we may not go
out of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgments, and thoſe Divine, there are extant expreſs
Footſteps of the like Fact in Sacred Scriptures. <hi>Nathan,</hi> at the
command of God, pronounced to <hi>David,</hi> being a Murtherer and Adulterer,
<hi>Thy ſin</hi> (that is, the puniſhment of ſin) <hi>is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from thee, for thou ſhalt not dye;</hi> (which otherways the Law required)
<hi>but becauſe thou haſt given the Enemies of God occaſion to
blaſpheme God, that Son, which is born to thee,</hi> to wit, very near unto
thee, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of thy puniſhment, <hi>ſhall ſurely die</hi> 2 Sam.
12.13,14. <hi>Achab</hi> defileth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, both with Murder and Robbery; God
denounceth to him by <hi>Elias, That it ſhould come to paſs, that the Dogs
ſhould lick his Blood.</hi> Nevertheleſs, the ſame God ſeeing his Fear,
and a certain Reverence to the Deity, ſaid, <hi>I will not bring the
Evil</hi> (to wit, which himſelf had deſerved, and I had threatned) <hi>in
his days: In the days of his Son</hi> (who, beſides his own, ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
bear his Father's puniſhment) <hi>I will bring the Evil upon his
Houſe.</hi> In both, God relaxeth the Law or Threatning of Puniſhment, but
not without ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, by tranſlating the Puniſhment upon
another. And ſo he evidenceth both <pb n="121" facs="tcp:106819:65"/>his Clemency and
Severity or Hatred of Sin. So then God, willing to ſpare thoſe that were to
believe in Chriſt, had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, juſt and great Cauſes, why he
exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the puniſhment of our ſins of Chriſt being willing; to wit, that
I may uſe the words of <hi>Aelianus, That that which was once ratified may
not be diſanulled, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and leaſt
ſins ſhould be leſs regarded, if ſo many, and ſo great, ſhould be
paſſed over without an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi> Moreover, by this very thing God did
not only teſtifie his hatred againſt ſins,. and ſo by this Fact
terrified us from ſins; (for it is eaſily gathered, if God would not
forgive ſins, no not to them that repent, unleſs Chriſt ſucceeded into
the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ſhment, (much leſs will
he ſuffer the Impenitent to be unpuniſhed) but alſo in a ſignal manner
declared his great Love and Good-will towards us; to wit, that he ſpared us,
to whom it was not a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to puniſh ſins, but who thought it
a thing of ſo great Concernment, that rather than he would ſuffer them to
be wholly unpuniſhed, he delivered up his only begotten Son to puniſhment
for thoſe ſins. So that, as it was ſaid by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>That it was
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <pb n="122" facs="tcp:106819:66"/>neither
according to the Law, nor againſt the Law, but above the Law, and inſtead
of the Law.</hi> That is very true of Divine Grace: It is above the Law,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not puniſhed; for the Law, becauſe Puniſhment is not
omitted: And therefore is Remiſſion given, that we may in time to come,
live to the Divine Law.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being rightly underſtood, all thoſe things fall
which <hi>Socinus</hi> objects concerning the Defect of a Cauſe. So that it
is not neceſſary to go through all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, in which nevertheleſs
not a few Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours may be obſerved. As, when in the firſt Chapter of the
firſt Book, alſo in the firſt Chapter of the third Book,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e ſays, <hi>That puniſhing
Juſtice doth not reſide in God, but is an Effect of his Will.</hi> Verily
to puniſh is an Effect of the Will; but that Juſtice or Rectitude, out of
which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds both other things, and alſo Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Puniſhment is a
Property reſiding in God; for the Scripture concludes God to be juſt,
becauſe he renders Puniſhment to Faults, gathering the Cauſe from the
Effect. But <hi>Socinus</hi> ſeems to have been led into this Errour,
becauſe he believed <pb n="123" facs="tcp:106819:66"/>that any Effects of the Properties
of God are altogether neceſſary, whereas many of them are free, to wit, a
free Act of the Will interveening between the Property and the Effect: So it is
an Effect of the Goodneſs of God to communicate his own Goodneſs; but this
he did not before the Creation. It belongs to the ſame Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſpare
the Guilty: but ſcarcely will any man ſay, that God ſpares thoſe, whom
he puniſheth with Eternal Puniſhment. Therefore there are ſome Properties
of God, the Exerciſe whereof, both as to the Act, and alſo as to the Time
and Manner of the Act, yea, alſo as to the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Object,
depends upon his free Will, over which nevertheleſs Wiſdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
Neither can God therefore be ſaid, becauſe he hath the free uſe of
theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, to do what he doth without a Cauſe, when he uſeth
them. For God did not therefore make the World in vain, becauſe he had
liberty not to make it; neither becauſe it pleaſed God to puniſh ſome
(which <hi>Socinus</hi> confeſſeth to be true chiefly in thoſe, whoſe
Repentance God waits for) doth he therefore puniſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, where he
puniſheth: for many things are performed freely, and yet for a weighty
cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:106819:67"/>The other Errour is alſo above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
that he would make God forgiving ſins, to do juſt the ſame thing that men
do, who give up their own right. It hath been ſhewed that puniſhment is not
in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or Debt, or that it can be equallized to them in all things. To
give a man's own, to forgive Debt is always honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it ſelf. When we
ſay of it ſelf, we exclude thoſe things which are preſent,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>by accident,</hi> ſuch as
is the Poverty of the Giver himſelf; which alſo cannot have place in God.
But to forgive Puniſhment ſometimes, would not be honourable, no not to God
himſelf, as <hi>Socinus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth: Therefore there is a wide
diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence here; but the riſe of the difference is thence, that the next
Foundation of Lordly Power and Debt is a certain Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a thing to a
Perſon: but the next foundation of Puniſhment is the Relation of a thing to
a thing, to wit, the Equality of a Fault with ſome Hurt agreeing to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and common Good: wherefore that is not true, which <hi>Socinus</hi>
aſſerted as moſt certain, <hi>That the Common-wealth will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no
unjuſtice, if it abſolve a Guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, except it alſo be injurious
to the proper right of ſome private Perſon, or break God's 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106819:67"/>Law.</hi> For by the name of <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> he
either underſtands the Multitude that governs, or is governed. The Multitude
that is governed, as it hath not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of making Laws, ſo neither hath
it the power of moderating them. But a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that Governs, as a Senate in
the State of Peers, or the greater part of a Parliament in a Popular State,
cannot do more than other chiefeſt, Governours; as for example, free Kings in
a Kingdom, and Fathers in reſpect of a Family. But it is part of the
Juſtice of a Governour to keep Laws, yea, thoſe alſo that are poſitive
and given by himſelf, which Lawyers prove to be true, as well in a free
Univerſity, as in the higheſt King. The Reaſon of both is, becauſe the
Act of Making or Relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Law, is not an Act of Abſolute Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but
an Act of Empire, which ought to tend to the Preſervation of Good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>That alſo, which <hi>Socinus</hi> ſays, deſerves
Reprehenſion, <hi>That beſides the Will of God and Christ himſelf, there
can be no lawful Cauſe given of the Death of Chriſt, unleſs we ſay,
Chriſt deſerved that he ſhould dye.</hi> For Merit is in the Antecedent
Cauſe, as we ſaid above, but Imperſonally; for our <pb n="126" facs="tcp:106819:68"/>ſins deſerved that Puniſhment ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: But that
Puniſhment was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon Chriſt, this we ſo refer to the Will of
God and Chriſt, that that Will hath alſo its own Cauſes, not in the
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt (who when he knew no ſin, was made ſin by God) but in
the great fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt to ſhew a ſignal Example; which
conſiſts both in his great Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with us, and in the unmatched
dignity of his Perſon. But that Collection of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> is confuted
by manifeſt Teſtimonies of Scripture. The Antecedent Cauſe, Why the
Infant of <hi>David</hi> died? is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; becauſe <hi>David</hi> by
ſinning heinouſly, gave occaſion to the wicked to inſult over the Name
of God blaſphemouſly. Here there is Merit, but not in the Infant. And in
puniſhing the Poſterity of <hi>Achab</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their own Merit, God had
reſpect to the Merit of the ſins of <hi>Achab.</hi> Whence it appears that
the Antecedent Cauſe of Puniſhment is Merit, but not always the Merit of
the Perſon that is puniſhed.</p>

3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>We, together with Scripture, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that God willed
this, and did it. For Chriſt is ſaid to have been delivered up, to have
ſuffered and died for our ſins,</hi> Rom. 4.25. 1 Pet. 3.18. Iſai. 53.5.
<hi>The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of our Peace was laid upon Chriſt. God laid upon
Chriſt our ſins,</hi> that is, <hi>the <pb n="128" facs="tcp:106819:69"/>puniſhment of
ſins, which were ſo required, that he, upon that account was afflicted;
Chriſt did bear our ſins,</hi> that is again, <hi>the puniſhment of
ſins,</hi> Iſai. 53.5,6,7. 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>Chriſt made himſelf Sin and
a Curſe,</hi> that is, <hi>liable to the puniſhment of ſins,</hi> Iſai.
53.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>The Blood of Christ was
ſhed for the Remiſſion of ſins; ſo that that Remiſſion did not
come to paſs without the ſhedding of Blood, but by it.</hi> Matth. 26.28.
Hebr. 9.22. <hi>and elſewhere in many places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Socinus</hi> oppoſeth many things: Some Examples and
Promiſes before Chriſt; ſome ſayings concerning thoſe things, that
God ſaid he gave by Chriſt. The word <hi>remittere</hi> and
<hi>cordonare,</hi> to <hi>forgive</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and the very
nature of Liberality, from which he thinks it follows, that God willeth to
grant Impunity to us repenting, requiring no puniſhment of any man upon that
account. As touching the Examples of Indulgence (beſides that no univerſal
thing is rightly concluded from them) it muſt be obſerved, that theſe
belong either to Temporal Puniſhment or Eternal. If they belong to Temporal
Puniſhment on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the difference is manifeſt: for as it is proverbially
ſaid, <hi>That which is deferred is</hi> 
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:106819:69"/>not taken away.
Now add this, that in the very Fact of <hi>Achab,</hi> as alſo in the Fact of
<hi>David,</hi> the contrary appears of that which <hi>Socinus</hi> would
infer, alledging them for himſelf: for the Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was ſo
taken away from <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Achab,</hi> that it was tranſlated
unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And in the Law it ſelf, ſins are not forgiven, except the
Blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices be poured out, as ſhall be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards.
But if the remiſſion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Puniſhment be the matter of
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>Socinus</hi> proves by no Argument, that it was made to any
man without a reſpect of God to Chriſt. The ſame muſt be ſaid of
Promiſes, that hath been ſaid of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and by the way it muſt be
obſerved. That when God promiſeth to them that repent, that he will forgive
Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, that ſhould not be underſtood always of the whole
puniſhment, but of ſo much: for God often uſeth to puniſh them alſo
that repent, but fatherly and gently. So God reſtored his people, when they
repented; from the Babyloniſh Captivity unto their Country, but reſtored
not the former Liberty and Glory of the Kingdom. But as touching Eternal
Puniſhment, there is no Promiſe of Remiſſion, which excludes a
reſpect to Chriſt. <pb n="130" facs="tcp:106819:70"/>Hitherto belong thoſe ſayings
of Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which ſhew <hi>that Chriſt taſted death for all
men, without any difference of time; that he gave himſelf
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Ranſom for all,</hi> Heb.
2.9. 1 Tim. 2.6. and much more thoſe that by a Compariſon being added,
admit no reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time; as when all are ſaid <hi>to have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and to be juſtified by Redemption in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3.23. and when
<hi>Righteouſneſs is ſaid to have come by one Chriſt upon all</hi> (to
wit, <hi>as many as are juſtified</hi>) <hi>as by one</hi> Adam
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation came upon all men,</hi> Rom. 3.12. 5.17,18. 1 Cor. 15.22.
Hence it is that Chriſt is called <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World,</hi> Apoc. 13.8. which place is ſufficiently vindicated from
the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Socinus,</hi> both by the very coherence of the
words, and alſo by a like place of <hi>Peter,</hi> where <hi>Redemption</hi>
is ſaid to be made <hi>by the Blood of Chriſt, the unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and
unſpotted Lamb, that was foreknown before the foundation of the World, but
made manifest in the laſt times,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19,20. Wherefore elſewhere
<hi>the Death of Chriſt</hi> is ſaid <hi>to have interpoſed for the
Redemption of thoſe Tranſgreſſions that had been under the former
Covenant,</hi> Hebr. 9.15. and <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God</hi> is ſaid
<hi>to be declared by his Blood, for the pardoning of ſins that 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106819:70"/>went before, which God is ſhewed to have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated and
ſuffered at that time, the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Righteouſneſs being deferred to
the time of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 3.25. Hereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs that famous place to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> 3.25. not that he ſhould often offer up himſelf, as
the Chief Prieſt <hi>entered once a year into the Sancturry with the Blood of
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> or elſe he ſhould have ſuffered of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the Foundation
of the World: <hi>but now he hath been made manifeſt once in the end of the
World, to take away ſin by the offering up of himſelf; and as it is
appointed for all men once to die, and after this the Judgment; ſo Chriſt
was once offered, that he might carry up the ſins of many,</hi> &amp;c. The
whole coherence of which place, if it be rightly conſidered, and eſpecially
if that place of <hi>Peter</hi> be compared, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. where the
ſame thing is diſcourſed of almoſt in the ſame words, it will appear
that in this the Sacrifice of Chriſt differs from the Levitical, becauſe
the Efficacy was limited within the time of a year, but the Efficacy of that
extends it ſelf through all Ages: for his Paſſion was eſteemed with God
as performed before all Ages, though really it was performed in a certain time,
and ſo the decree of God, was very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly revealed unto us. And
unleſs it had <pb n="132" facs="tcp:106819:71"/>been ſo, Chriſt muſt often have
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went Sufferings, not after he began to preach, but from the beginning of
the World. Which words have no ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, unleſs the Efficacy
of the Death of Chriſt extend it ſelf to all ſins, which have any time
been forgiven to men, from the very beginning of the World: Juſt as the
Judgment after Death extends it ſelf to all ſins that a man committed,
during life. But the contrary Interpretation of <hi>Socinus,</hi> doth not only
render the words vain, but weakens the Argument of the Writer: for it doth not
follow, if it were granted that Chriſt ſhould have often been offered, that
he ought to have ſuffered, not only often, but often from the Foundation of
the World; unleſs you put together, that Chriſt ſhould have been often
offered from the Foundation of the World; for theſe have a coherence with one
another: for the Effect of the Oblation is not ſtretched farther than the
Dignity of the Sacrifice. But that Chriſt ſhould have been offered
oft-times from the Foundation of the World, if the parity of the Sacrifice of
Chriſt and the Levitical were granted, which the Writer of the Epiſtle to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> oppoſeth, it would not follow <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106819:71"/>from
any other thing, but becauſe the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Oblation of Chriſt is
extended unto thoſe ſins that were at any time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and forgiven
from the Foundation of the World: For if it were equal to the Levitical, (that
is, of a vertue limited within a certain time) verily its Efficacy could not
reach from the time that Chriſt died, unto the moſt ancient ſins. But it
would have been altogether neceſſary, that many Acts of that kind ſhould
have been interpoſed between both times.</p>
            <p>Now let us come to thoſe Teſtimonies, that ſeem to
<hi>Socinus</hi> properly to belong to the time of Chriſt, and the New
Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> indeed ſays, <hi>God will be propitious to
ſins:</hi> but denies not that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>That this
Propitiation is made in the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> or, <hi>that God hath
reſpect unto Chriſt;</hi> yea, <hi>all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> (among whom
alſo <hi>Jeremiah</hi>) <hi>bear witneſs that remiſſion of ſins is
received by the Name,</hi> that is, the Efficacy and Virtue of Chriſt,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. And Deliverance by Chriſt is ſaid to have come to us
according to that <hi>Covenant which God made with the Fathers;</hi> and
according to thoſe <hi>things that he foretold by the Prophets,</hi> Luke
1.68,70,71,72,73,74. The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> alſo at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106819:72"/>of God, promiſeth <hi>remiſſion to the Penitent, and
that for the Bowels of Mercy of our God;</hi> but the ſame ſaid, <hi>That
Chriſt is the Lamb that taketh away the ſins of the World,</hi> to wit, by
<hi>Sacrificing,</hi> which the <hi>Revelation</hi> expreſſeth, or by
<hi>Blood,</hi> as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeaketh; in which places likewiſe the

ſhewed above, how much difference there is between the <hi>remiſſion of
Debt</hi> and the <hi>remiſſion of Puniſhment:</hi> and that in the
remiſſion of ſin, which is made <pb n="135" facs="tcp:106819:72"/>by a Governour,
there is no abdication of ſuch a proper and private right as <hi>Socinus</hi>
mentioneth, to wit, abſolute Lordſhip, or Debt: therefore theſe things
may be fetch'd thence. Now that only muſt be added, <hi>That it is not true,
which</hi> Socinus <hi>would have, that remiſſion is contrary to any
pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment going before.</hi> Which that it may be underſtood, we ſhall
repreſent a certain Deſcription of Remiſſion of Debt, which contains
under it both thoſe kinds, to wit, of Debt and Puniſhment; and that
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſe of that word, both in Civil Law, and in common Speech:
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to forgive a Debt is an Act, either of a Creditor or Governour,
freeing the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Perſon from the Obligation of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Debt. We
ſhall give a larger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for the ſake of thoſe, who are not well
acquainted with Terms of Law; the deſtruction of Obligation in Law is called
<hi>liberatio,</hi> freeing. Payment may go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, it cannot follow it;
becauſe no Act can be exerciſed about that which is no more. Therefore
<hi>liberatio,</hi> freeing, comes ſometimes when ſome Payment goes before,
ſometimes without any Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But one Payment frees <hi>ipſo facto,</hi>
and another not <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> at the very time <pb n="136" facs="tcp:106819:73"/>of
Payment. The Payment of a thing that is wholly the ſame with what was in the
Obligation, frees <hi>ipſo facto:</hi> and it is the ſame ſenſe,
whether a guilty Perſon himſelf pay, or another for him, to this intent
that he may be freed. Which ſhould therefore be obſerved, becauſe if
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man pay the ſame for another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>liberatio,</hi> freedom,
is not thereby procured. <hi>L. ſi poena l. in ſumma D. de cond. indeb. l.
Caſſius D. de ſolut.</hi> Therefore where the ſame is paid by a Debtor,
or by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the name of a Debtor, there is no remiſſion; for the
Creditor or Governour doth nothing about the Debt. Wherefore if any man
ſuffer the puniſhment that he ought, hence will be deliverance, but not
remiſſion. And Lawyers call the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a Deliverance in
the right of the Debt, properly and ſtrictly

<hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>parag.</hi> 2. <hi>d. de reb. cred.</hi> but it is
neceſſary that ſome Act of the Creditor or Governour ſhould be added
thereto, which Act rightly and uſually is called remiſſion. And ſuch a
payment, that may either be admitted or refuſed, <pb n="137" facs="tcp:106819:73"/>being
admitted in Law, it hath the ſpecial name of Satisfaction, which is
ſometimes oppoſed unto Payment more ſtrictly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>L. Satisfactio
D. de ſolut.</hi> And hence the true Cauſe is to be brought, why a Vicar of
Corporal Puniſhment cannot <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deliver a guilty Perſon by
paying the puniſhment. For this happeneth firſt and of it ſelf, not
becauſe another paid, (for that hindereth not the liberation, if ſo be it
is the will of the payer) but becauſe he paid another thing than what is in
the Obligation; for there is in the Obligation the puniſhing of him who
ſinned: whence it uſeth to be ſaid, <hi>That the Head follows a
Crime:</hi> which may alſo be ſeen in other Obligations to a Fact that are
meerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, as in a Contract of Marriage, and in the Obligation of
Workmen in Office. <hi>L. Operae de operis libert.</hi> For in all theſe, if
another pay, deliverance will not follow <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> becauſe
together with that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is paid; therefore that by the puniſhment
of one man, Deliverance may come to another, ſome Act of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſhould interpoſe: for the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him that ſinned to be puniſhed.
This Act, in reſpect of the Law, is Relaxation or Diſpenſation, in
reſpect of the Debtor, <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106819:74"/>Remiſſion. But deliverance
without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes to paſs, either by the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of a new
Obligation, or by a total reſcinding thereof. The ſubſtitution of a new
Obligation, whereby deliverance is made, is called <hi>novatio,</hi> novation;
and if the Perſon of the Debtor is changed, <hi>dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</hi> But the
<hi>liberatio,</hi> deliverance, which wholly deſtroys the Debt without any
payment, it is performed with ſolemn words about the Debt; in Civil Law it is
called <hi>acceptilation,</hi> a verbal diſcharge of Debt. But about
Puniſhment, it hath not a proper name, that excludes neceſſarily payment
of what manner ſoever, or how great ſoever; but it is called by a common
name, <hi>gratia, venia, indulgentia, abolitio,</hi> grace, pardon, indulgence,
abolition. Therefore <hi>Socinus</hi> is twice deceived, when he applies the
word <hi>acceptilatio,</hi> verbal diſcharge, taken out of the Law, to that
Remiſſion which God grants to us. For firſt, that word, at the very time
when no payment went before, may be applied to the right of Debt, but cannot,
neither uſeth to be applied to puniſhment: for no man hath read that
indulgence of Crimes hath been called <hi>acceptilatio</hi> by any ancient
Writer; for that thing <hi>accepta fertur,</hi> is <pb n="139" facs="tcp:106819:74"/>ſaid
to be received, that can be received. But a Governour really requires Corporal
Puniſhment, but receives it not, becauſe nothing of the puniſhment comes
proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him. Moreover, <hi>acceptilatio</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to any manner
of payment: whence it is figuratively defined an imaginary pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But
<hi>Chriſt gave his life <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

that is, we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by ſome payment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. and 7.23.
concerning which more largely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Therefore there is not
<hi>accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> here. Alſo it is not the payment of the very thing
that was due, which deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> for our Death, and that
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Death was in the Obligation: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it <hi>novation</hi> or
<hi>delegation:</hi> for after our being delivered, another like Debt, or
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Debtor doth not ſucceed. But it is a <hi>Remiſſion,
Satisfaction</hi> going before; which things <hi>Socinus</hi> falſly judgeth
to be contrary to one another; whenas on the contrary all Satisfaction (that
is, refuſable payment) is therefore admitted, that there may be place for
Remiſſion. But when we ſay, Satisfaction goes before, that muſt be
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood either in the Act it ſelf, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth in the ſins of
Chriſtians, or in a <pb n="140" facs="tcp:106819:75"/>certain and irrevocable Decree, as
in the ſins committed and forgiven under the Law: for what God hatch decreed
to do, is eſteemed as already performed; and if ſo be the Debt be truly
paid, it is the ſame ſenſe at what time it is paid, eſpecially with
him, who knoweth all things, that are certainly to come to paſs; and
perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſees and beholds them as preſent; which is the confeſſion
of <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf. Therefore thoſe things that <hi>Socinus</hi>
brings to prove that Satisfaction cannot follow after <hi>Remiſſion,</hi>
or come to paſs together, and that there is not here any <hi>novation</hi> or
<hi>delagation,</hi> alſo that there may be ſome <hi>liberation,</hi> where
there is no <hi>remiſſion,</hi> are ſaid in vain, and belong not to our
queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But that which he ſays, <hi>That by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction the Debt is
wholly and preſently taken away,</hi> belongs indeed to the matter, but is
not true, except Satisfaction, againſt the Cuſtom of the Law, be taken for
the payment of the thing that is due, made by him that oweth it; concerning
which we diſcourſe. But where another pays for a Debtor, and where another
thing is paid than what is due, here a twofold Act of of the Will is required
for <hi>liberation.</hi> For both he that payeth ought to will this, 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106819:75"/>that the Debtor may be delivered, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deliverance
comes not, as we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, and the Creditor or Governour ought to admit
the payment of one thing for another. Wherefore ſeeing that every man may
impoſe a Law upon an Act de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon his own Will, as that which is
purely due, may be <hi>novated (renewed)</hi> upon a Condition, <hi>L. quoties
D. de Novat.</hi> So alſo he that pays for another, and he who admits the
paying of one thing for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, may make a Covenant that
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> may preſently follow, or upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, alſo
either purely or upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But this was the Mind and Will, this was the
Agreement and Covenant both of Chriſt ſatisfying, and of God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Satisfaction; not that God ſhould preſently forgive ſins in the very time
of the Suffering of Chriſt, but that it ſhould be at length, when Man being
converted to God by true Faith in Chriſt, begs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don humbly, to which
alſo is joyned Chriſt's Advocateſhip or Interceſſion with the Father.
Therefore here Satisfaction doth not hinder Remiſſion to follow: for
Satisfaction had not by this time taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Debt, but performed this,
that for the ſake thereof the Debt ſhould at ſome time be taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:106819:76"/>
               <hi>Socinus</hi> adds a prop to the word
<hi>Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> that was it ſelf without Efficacy, out of a Parable,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and that with a twofold Argument: Firſt, <hi>That God is
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a King forgiving a Servant the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that he owed him;</hi>
adding no mention of any Satisfaction: and then, <hi>That we are implicitely
commanded to do the ſame thing that God doth: and that we ought not ſo to
forgive our Offenders, as to require puniſhment of their Friends.</hi> But
the Anſwer is eaſie, that the Compariſon is ſtretched beyond that
whereunto it hath reſpect: which is vicious in every Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from
ſimilitude. Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares himſelf to a <hi>Thief,</hi> and us to a
<hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> giving gifts of that which was another mans; not that either
he himſelf takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a thing that is another man's, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the will of
its Poſſeſſor, or that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to do the ſame: but he compares
himſelf to a <hi>Thief,</hi> becauſe he comes at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares; and us to a
<hi>Steward,</hi> becauſe it becomes us to do that with our own, which he did
with that which was not his own. So in that Parable <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. Bounty
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Neighbour is commended unto us, becauſe God is
<hi>bountiful</hi> towards us. In this the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>God</hi> agree
in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <pb n="143" facs="tcp:106819:76"/>
               <hi>That they are bountiful to them that
are far below them. God teſtifies this bounty by pardoning ſins; the King
by pardoning mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that was due.</hi> As there is another kind of owing, ſo
there is another kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. The King and God diſagree in this,
<hi>That a King forgives without Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, God not without
Satisfaction.</hi> But the Compariſon lies not in that. Alſo there is
another Reaſon: for concerning Debt, which right is provided for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Creditour, every man hath a moſt free power of appointing: and how
much leſs he requires, he is ſo much the more liberal: but in exacting he
exerciſeth no Act of Vertue. But concerning Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which belongs to
the common Good and Order, a Governour indeed hath power, but not ſuch a
power as goes beyond bounds: And when he requires Puniſhment, he uſeth a
certain Vertue, that is called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding Juſtice,</hi> as we ſhew'd
above. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other Compariſon which is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us in
the Moral of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, no other thing can be inferred from thence, but that
it is not juſt that we ſhould be rigider towards an Equal, than God, who is
ſo much above us, is towards us that are miſerable men. Hence it follows,
that <pb n="144" facs="tcp:106819:77"/>we ought not to require Revenge, more than God
requires Puniſhment. But God delivered us from Puniſhment: Therefore we
alſo ought to be without the deſire of Revenge. But how God performed that
Deliverance, it is not ſaid there, neither is it to the purpoſe: for in
that there is not a Similitude, but a Diſſimilitude; for God is a Judge, we
are private Perſons. It is convenient for a Judge to be ſolicitous
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an Example: that Care belongs not to private Perſons. The power
of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing is comprehended in the Office of a Judge: the ſame is taken
away from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons. What if that Compariſon be too much preſſed
(as it is by <hi>Socinus</hi>) it would follow, that men being Judges, ought
not to require Puniſhment of any guilty Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinus,</hi> in ſome reſpect, acknowledging the name of
<hi>Remiſſion</hi> not to be forcible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to exclude all kinds of
Payment or Satisfaction, expects ſome more help from that other word

before, that it was nothing elſe but to ſignifie any benefit, eſpecially
that which was not due. <pb n="145" facs="tcp:106819:77"/>But that, which <hi>Socinus</hi>
puts for a thing moſt certain, that this alſo is required to the
ſignification of that word, that a man ſhould take ſomething from
himſelf, and ſhould deprive himſelf of a benefit of his own, is not true.
For not only all thoſe things, that are mentioned in many places of the

               </gap>, that ſomething of advantage

Agent.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we ſhewed above, that a Governour in puniſhment doth
not abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any thing proper and private; and that is the more evident in
this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
is not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God, but alſo to Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. but
the injury of ſin is directed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly againſt God; ſo that if, upon
that account, God forgiving ſins, ſhould be ſaid, to take away from
himſelf that which is his own, yet the ſame cannot be ſaid of Chriſt,
as Mediatour. Neither is that more true which <hi>Socinus</hi> deduceth from

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is contrary to any
Satisfaction.</hi> For it is not contrary to that Satisfaction, which is both
freely admitted, when it could have been rejected, and unto which he that
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the benefit contributed nothing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: We are in vain
ſolicitous concerning that word <hi>condonare,</hi> becauſe the Holy
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit cauſed not any thing to be written in that Language. What if yet this
word <pb n="147" facs="tcp:106819:78"/>alſo ſhould appear in Sacred Scripture? Yet,
becauſe in Puniſhment a Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on properly ſo called, hath no place,
neither is the Tranſlation of that word unuſual, nothing could hence be
inferred againſt Satisfaction, a thing may be ſaid rightly to be forgiven,
as alſo to be pardoned then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, when payment is made, but ſuch a
pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as hath no power to purchaſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration without an act of the Will.
For Princes alſo when they give pardon unto perſons guilty of Capital
Crimes, they uſe to require of them both ſome Mulct, and a certain publick
deprecation of the Fault: neither yet are they therefore ſaid the leſs to
forgive Crimes. Therefore how much more juſtly may that word be uſed here,
where the required satisfaction proceeds not from us, but Liberation comes
altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther freely in reſpect of us, though not freely abſolutely? which
the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, when it ſays, <hi>we are juſtified freely;</hi>
and immediately adds, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>by the
redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 30.24. Verily, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
Scripture ſays not in one place on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that we are redeemed,</hi> and
that <hi>with a price,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf,</hi> or
<hi>his Fleſh, to deliver us,</hi> no Equity ſuffers to 
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106819:79"/>overthrow all the force of theſe, by urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word
<hi>condonare</hi> beyond what the uſe of the word requires.</p>
            <p>But to that other Argument of <hi>Socinus,</hi> which is drawn from
the imitation of God and Chriſt in freely giving, which we are commanded,
there is no need that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ſhould be anſwered, but what we have
already ſaid on the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. that the thing is propoſed
to our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not the manner of the thing. The thing is the Bounty it
ſelf, even after ſin; and the Remiſſion following from it, or the
Forgiving (if ſo you are pleaſed to ſpeak) the manner is different; in
God Satisfaction going before; in us without it; neither is it any wonder,
becauſe God is a Judge, and we private Perſons. What if a man conſider
the matter more nicely, he will find that all Satisfaction is not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
wholly from that Condonation that is commanded to us, but that only which in
reſpect of the Perſon, to wit, an Equal, not a Superiour, exceeds
meaſure. For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Confeſſion of a Fault and Deprecation (which
Chriſt forbids not to be required, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.4,5.) is ſo far from
diſagreeing with Satisfaction, that elegant Latin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do call it, as it
were by a peculiar <pb n="149" facs="tcp:106819:79"/>name, <hi>Satisfacere,</hi> to
ſatisfie. So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> concerning the
<hi>Corinthian,</hi> when yet the Rebuke of many had went before, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. And we know, that in the Ages next the Apoſtles, the peace
of the Church, as they called it, was not given to them that fell, but after
ſome publick Acts of Submiſſion, which they therefore called
<hi>Satisfactions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon drawn from Liberality leans upon a weak Foundation.
For, as we ſhewed before, that the Vertue, which God uſeth in forgiving of
ſins, is not Liberality, but Clemency, which <hi>Seneca</hi> rightly
defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Meekneſs of a Superiour towards an Inſeriour in appointing
puniſhment. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> putting the name of a Gender for a Species,
called this ſame Clemency <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and defined it, Juſtice
placed in the moderation of Puniſhment, taking the word Juſtice in ſo
large a ſenſe, that it comprehends Piety, and Faith, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

of God, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

which is more, the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
<hi>Liberality,</hi> is not applied to God; no not in other things that uſe
to be given and received; but this Vertue alſo is rather called <hi>the Love
of God;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it properly belongs to Liberality ſo to give a thing,
that it periſheth to the giver. But that <hi>Socinus,</hi> with great
intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of Speech, condemns the conſtant Opinion of the Church of
Impiety and Sacriledge; becauſe that he himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth a twofold
Liberality of God, and we only a ſimple, in that thing he doth a great injury
to the Truth: for our Opinion alſo acknowledgeth in God a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, not
Liberality (for that word is unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this matter, and unuſual to
Scripture) but Bounty, and that much greater than that lately ſtarted up
Opinion of <hi>Socinus.</hi> The former Bounty is, that God ſeeing he was
ſtirred up with great hatred againſt ſin, and could have as well been
utterly unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpare us, as he was utterly unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſpare the
Angels that finned, yet that he might ſpare us, he did not only admit ſuch
a payment, as he was not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to admit, but he alſo himſelf of his 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106819:80"/>own accord found it out. Verily this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is much
greater and much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, than if God, judging it a matter of no value,
whether ſome Example were made, or not, had ſuffered our ſins to go
unpuniſhed, as <hi>Socinus</hi> would have. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Glemency of God is
not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the payment of puniſhment, becauſe to admit ſuch
payment, and much more to invent it, proceeded from meer Clemency.</p>
            <p>The other Bounty is, that <hi>he delivered up to death his own
Son,</hi> being moſt dear unto him, <hi>the Image of himſelf,</hi> and, if
it is lawful ſo to ſpeak, his other ſelf, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he might give a
Teſtimony to the Truth of the Doctrine, and ſo might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the
Reſurrection (within which <hi>Socinus</hi> contained himſelf) but chiefly
that he might perform that payment or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by ſuffering the
puniſhment of our ſins: in which part <hi>Socinus</hi> ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that he would owe much leſs to Chriſt than we owe: yea, this evidenceth
that a greater love of God is declared by us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is juſt, that
Benefits ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed not only for the Expence, but chiefly for the
Advantage that by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence redounds unto the perſon on whom 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106819:81"/>the Benefit is beſtowed. But we, beſides the
Advantages which together with us <hi>Socinus</hi> confeſſeth, acknowledge
a chief one, which he denies. Neither ſay we, <hi>That God beſtowed his
Son, that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might receive his own, and ſo make God
ſordid,</hi> with which <hi>Socinus</hi> upbraids us: but we ſay, <hi>God
therefore did it that he might openly declare the merit of ſin, and his own
hatred againſt our ſins, and alſo that he might conſult the order of
things, and his own Law, as much as be could in ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us.</hi> Neither is
that leſs unjuſt, and that I may uſe his own word, cruel, that he ſats,
<hi>we make God cruel.</hi> For that end of the Satisfaction being added, makes
the Sufferings of Chriſt no heavier: which <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is compelled to
confeſs, <hi>that they were laid upon him by God without any cruelty:</hi>
yea, how many more ends there are, ſo much farther is the appearance of
Cruelty removed: for he is a cruel perſon, that without cauſe, or for a
light cauſe, tormenteth any one. Moreover, this end of Satisfaction, or
bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puniſhment, coheres with the Death of Chriſt much more evidently,
and with a much ſurer connexion, than thoſe ends that <hi>Socinus</hi>
acknowledgeth: for Miracles could give Teſtimony to the Doctrine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nougn 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106819:81"/>and abundantly: Alſo Celeſtial Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could have been
conferred upon Chriſt without the intervening of Death: but Death, ſuch a
Death eſpecially is fitted properly for ſuffering Puniſhments, and
puniſhment for procuring deliverance.</p>
            <p>But though we hitherto ſhewed that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction was made to God
by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, yet we deſire not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the force
of ſatisfaction is in the very action of Chriſt. For oftimes an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
action uſeth to be admitted inſtead of a puniſhment. <hi>A benefit coming
after,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, ſuffereth not an injury to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> Lib.
6. cap. 5. In which place he ſheweth, that to render is to give a thing for a
thing, and that by payment the ſame thing is not paid, but ſo much. But
though God, that needeth nothing, cannot receive a Benefit, yet his great
Goodneſs taketh any Dutifulneſs for a Benefit. So <hi>Achab</hi> prevented
a Temporal puniſhment by <hi>calling humbly upon God.</hi> Neither doth only
a mans own action profit him for freedom from puniſhment, but alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man's, with whom he is joyned. So puniſhment was forgiven to the Poſterity
of <hi>David,</hi> for the ſake of <hi>David</hi> himſelf, 2.
<hi>Kings</hi> 8.19. not only for the Promiſes <pb n="154" facs="tcp:106819:82"/>made to
<hi>David;</hi> but alſo becauſe the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>David</hi> pleaſed
God judging graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of them, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.13. and 20.6. So
<hi>Aelianus</hi> tells, That <hi>Aeſchylus was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from puniſhment,
becauſe his Brother</hi> Amyntas <hi>had acted valiantly for bis
Country.</hi> So amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> when <hi>Titus Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was accuſed, the Memory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitted him. <hi>Livius</hi>
concerning <hi>Appius;</hi> He commemorated the Merits of his Forefather
towards the Common-wealth, that he might deprecate puniſhment. Death was
forgiven to <hi>Plautius Lateranus</hi> for the eminent Merit of his Uncle. And
in the general, <hi>Salluſtius</hi> ſaid, <hi>If they offended their
ancient Nobility, the valiant Acts of their Anceſtors are preſent for a
Safeguard unto them.</hi> Cicero; <hi>It will behove him who ſhall require
that he may be pardoned, to produce good Deeds of his Predeceſſors, if any
are known.</hi> Quintilian; <hi>The Merits of Progenitors plead for a perſon
in danger.</hi> And as Works temporally good avail for a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral impunity,
ſo the Work of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly and ſpiritually good, availed for
deliverance from eternal puniſhment. Unto which that hath reference, <hi>By
the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of one man many are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> that is, <hi>they are
juſtified, they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <pb n="155" facs="tcp:106819:82"/>as innocent,</hi> Rom.
5.19. and that other <hi>for his Name,</hi> to wit, the Name of Chriſt, and
there was no mention of God before, as <hi>Socinus</hi> confeſſeth. And
more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the like Sentence proveth this ſame thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.
<hi>Our ſins are forgiven to us,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.13. For it is certain
that by this phraſe, <hi>for the name of a man,</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive cauſe
is ſignified: Neither can <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> prove the contrary by any place
of Scripture. But what we ſaid of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is firſt given to
the puniſhment, and afterward to the obedient action if ſelf, the ſame
ſhould be underſtood concerning the appeaſing God, concerning our

            <head>CHAP. VII. Concerning Propitiation and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation made by
the Death of Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SOcinus</hi> himſelf took care that no man might miſtake
this preſent Diſputation, as if it were concerning a word only; for he
profeſſeth in many places, <hi>That be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth not the naked word of
Satisfaction, but the thing it ſelf ſignified by the word: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Chriſt reconciled God unto us by his blood; Chriſt delivered us out of the
hands of Divine Juſtice, by giving thereunto his own blood, the price of our
Redemption; Chriſt made amends for our wicked works by his own obedience;
Chriſt worthily deſerved that God ſhould beſtow upon us the
remiſſion of ſins; Chriſt pacified the Anger of God by the loſs of
his life; Socinus</hi> no leſs diſallows all theſe, than the word
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> it ſelf, and yet if this Diſputation were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word, the Church cannot be juſtly <pb n="157" facs="tcp:106819:83"/>defrauded of the
liberty of interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. In which this alſo is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to
tranſlate very aptly into other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages thoſe things that either the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpake in Hebrew words, or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in Greek words, which
ſavoured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times of a Hebraiſm or Syrianiſm, or to epitomize in a
perſpicuous compend of words, thoſe things which belonged to the ſame
Matter the Scripture hath delivered in ſeveral places. So that which the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt was delivered to death for ſins,</hi>
and <hi>to have ſuffered ſins,</hi> that is, <hi>the puniſhment of
ſins,</hi> and <hi>that his blood was ſhed for the remiſſion of
ſins,</hi> is expreſſed in elegant Latine and ſignificantly by the word
<hi>ſatisfaciendi,</hi> of ſatisfying: for that word in Law or common uſe
ſignifies the exhibition of a Fact or Thing, from which Deliverance followeth
not <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> but an Act of the Will being joyned. And it uſeth
to be taken in this ſenſe, not only in pecuniary Debts, but alſo in
Crimes, which Languages that are derived of the <hi>Roman</hi> Language with
depravation, call <hi>contentare,</hi> to content. But that it may appear that
Expreſſions of the ſame value, yea, thoſe very Expreſſions that
<hi>Socinus</hi> rejects, are found in Sacred Scripture, we ſhall add 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106819:84"/>ſome other Teſtimon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s unto thoſe that were drawn out of the Sacred Book above in the
firſt Explication of this Sentence, and we ſhall refer them to four
Claſſes. The firſt Claſs ſhall be of thoſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that
ſignifie the turning away of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The other of thoſe that declare
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance made by Redemption or the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a price. The third of thoſe
that ſignifie Subrogation. The fourth of thoſe that aſcribe unto the
Death of Chriſt the vertue of an Expiatory Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>That we may enter upon the firſt Claſs, it is very well known,
that to turn away the wrath of a man, is called in the Greek Language,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and in the Latine <hi>placare,
pacare, conciliare, reconciliare,</hi> alſo <hi>propitiare,</hi> to
appeaſe, to pacify, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, to propitiate. Both the act it ſelf, and
alſo that by which the act is properly performed, is called by the Grecians
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and by the Latines
<hi>placamen.</hi> In God, Anger, as we ſaid above, is called by
<hi>anthropopathy,</hi> as it were the affection of puniſhing; which the
Apoſtle ſaith <hi>is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven upon all ungodlineſs and
unrighteouſneſs of men, that detain the Truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi>
that is, <hi>that go againſt <pb n="159" facs="tcp:106819:84"/>the known Commands of
Chriſt.</hi> But no man is excepted, becauſe <hi>we are all by nature the
ſons of wrath,</hi> that is, <hi>liable to the anger of God.</hi> This
<hi>anger abides upon ſome,</hi> Joh. 3.26. and it is turned from them,
<hi>upon whom it abides not.</hi> Chriſt by his Death attains this
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and therefore it is very rightly called <hi>Propitiation.</hi> So
<hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle calls him twice, when he ſays, <hi>If any man
ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous: and
he is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins
of all the world.</hi> Epiſt. 1. cap. 2. verſ. 2. <hi>Alſo, in this is
love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his ſon to be a
Propitiation for our ſins,</hi> cap. 4. verſ. 10. with which place that of
<hi>Paul</hi> muſt be compared; <hi>God commendeth his love, that when we
were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. for both <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> prove by the ſame Argument, that we did not <hi>firſt
love,</hi> but were <hi>beloved of God:</hi> and that which <hi>Paul</hi> calls
<hi>he died, John</hi> calls, <hi>he was made a Propitiation.</hi> Moreover,
that place of <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>We are juſtified freely by
the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a
Propitiation by Faith in his Blood.</hi> Therefore Chriſt was made a
Propitiation <pb n="160" facs="tcp:106819:85"/>in his own blood: which what is it elſe but
that very thing that <hi>Socinus</hi> denies, <hi>That God was reconciled in

               </gap> in all Greek Writers, Poets,

               </gap> mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> that

ſignifie properly a certain effective Vertue, and improperly a declarative,
no reaſon ſuffereth us here to depart from property; for it is evident that
Chriſt is ſo called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

of the wrath of God, or verily of this alſo. For <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
<hi>Paul</hi> after his own manner expreſſing twice the ſame thing, that
which he had ſaid before, that <hi>Chriſt died for the wicked and
ſinners,</hi> verſ. 6. and 8. preſently he expreſſeth the ſame in
theſe words, that <hi>when we were Enemies we were reconciled unto God by the
death of his Son,</hi> verſ. 10. And it appears by the oppoſite Member,
that this benefit is before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion it ſelf: <hi>If theſe
things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are ſo, much more now being juſtified by him,
we ſhall be ſaved from wrath,</hi> verſe 9. <hi>alſo much more being
reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> The Apoſtolick
Argumentation proceeds <hi>à majori.</hi> If God was ſo good towards
us before we were converted, what will he be to us being converted? Here the
word <hi>Reconciliation</hi> in the formed Member cannot ſignifie
<hi>Converſion;</hi> for the Apoſtle <pb n="164" facs="tcp:106819:87"/>obſerves ſome
ſingular thing in Chriſt; but to convert ſinners, is not ſuch a thing;
for they are not converted at any time, but being ſinners: But it is a rare,
and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſingular thing, to dye for ſinners, and to reconcile
ſinners by death, ſeeing that there have been always very few who would dye
for their Friends, being good men, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. Then Converſion is
more aptly aſcribed unto the glorious Life of Chriſt, than his Death; but
this Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is attributed to Death, diſtinguiſhed and
diſcriminated from a glorious Life, as the
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> oppoſite ſignification of the
word ſhews. Moreover, by the latter benefit it is given to be underſtood
what the former is. The latter that comes to the converted, is to <hi>have
peace with God,</hi> verſe 1. <hi>to be ſaved from wrath,</hi> verſ. 9.
and 10. The Apoſtle calls this ſame, <hi>to receive reconciliation,</hi>
verſe 11. What other thing is it here to receive reconciliation, but to
receive <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks,
<hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and 26.18. but to receive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is an unknown kind
of ſpeaking. If therefore in the latter Member to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive reconciliation is
to receive the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of ſinners, and in effect to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from wrath, or from puniſhment, <pb n="165" facs="tcp:106819:87"/>in the former Member
alſo to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhould have an analogical ſignification: that the
former Member may be a right to the thing, the latter an exhibition of the
ſame thing. Add unto all theſe, that the love of God cannot be ſaid, but
very unſutably and unaptly, to be gathered from this, that we have departed
from the hatred of God: For though <hi>Paul</hi> would have diſcourſed of
the benefit of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, it ſhould have been expreſſed with
anothergueſs word, that might ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie not our action but Gods. But
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more plain than our Interpretation, nothing more agreeable to the
Apoſtle's purpoſe. But that <hi>Socinus</hi> objects, that <hi>the mention
of ſatisfaction here is not ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> yea, <hi>that the praiſe of
love is thereby diminiſhed,</hi> it is a vain thing: for menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not made
of ſatisfaction in reſpect of its being a puniſhment, but as it is a way
of delivering us. Neither, as we proved before, can the love of God towards men
be more manifeſtly ſhewed any way, than that being angry, that is,
requiring pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, yet found a way for our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from puniſhment,
having beſtowed Chriſt for that purpoſe. In that place 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
about the end, as in that to the <pb n="166" facs="tcp:106819:88"/>
               <hi>Romans,</hi> there is
found mention of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Reconciliation. The former Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is that
whereby God <hi>reconciled all things,</hi> or the <hi>World to himſelf by
Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 18 and 19. The latter is that,
unto which the Apoſtles, as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Reconciliation, <hi>in whom the
word of Reconciliation is put, exhort men in the name of God and Chriſt,</hi>
verſ. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Therefore that former cannot be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion it ſelf; for it is
the Antecedent and chief Matter of that word by which converſion is made.
Moreover, <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſheweth that it conſiſts in the not
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of ſins, that is, in the decree of not imputing them. But now to
<hi>impute ſins,</hi> and to <hi>forgive them,</hi> ſignifie the ſame
thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6,7,8. But how is this Decree of not <hi>imputing
ſins</hi> founded on Chriſt? <hi>Paul</hi> will tell: for God made <hi>him
that knew no ſin to become ſin for us.</hi> That which <hi>Socinus</hi>
objects, <hi>That the not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſins is contrary to that way of
recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling by ſatisfaction,</hi> is without reaſon: for, as was explained
before, ſatisfaction goes before; afterwards emiſſion and non-impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſins follow. It may alſo be ſaid, that it is not abſolutely ſaid
that God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes not ſins, but that he imputes them <pb n="167" facs="tcp:106819:88"/>not
to them, that is, to the ſinners. And that ſin may be forgiven to one man,
or not be imputed to him, and that it may be imputed to another man for
example, or that another man may upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be afflicted and
puniſhed, it appears ſufficiently, both by many things, that we alledged
before, and alſo chiefly by that which happened to <hi>David.</hi> And though
theſe are not joyned immediately in words, <hi>not imputing ſins,</hi> and
<hi>he made him that knew no ſin to become ſin;</hi> that doth not make
them not to belong to the ſame thing. For theſe are joyned to one another
by conjunctive words <hi>(and)</hi> and <hi>(for)</hi> neither doth any new
ſpeech and differing from this argument come between: but this is ſaid,
that God hath made the Apoſtles Ambaſſadors and Miniſters of the
benefit by him beſtowed, to wit, that they were ſent for this purpoſe
through the World, that they might plant the Faith of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit in men by
their preaching. But the ſtrongeſt argument for making that Faith, is from
the delivering up of Chriſt unto Death: for it is not credible, that God
would have had his Son, that was moſt dear to him, and moſt innocent, ſo
heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted, except he had propoſed ſome <pb n="168" facs="tcp:106819:89"/>excellent end unto himſelf. But this end, to wit, the proper end,
and moſt nearly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to that fact, Scripture every where, and reaſon
it ſelf in ſome reſpect by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction teſtifying, can ſcarcely be any
other but the obtaining the right of pardon by antecedent ſatisfaction: But
that, <hi>we requeſt you in Christ's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God;</hi>
though, according to the nature of the word, it may ſignifie, either caſt
ye away your hatred towards God, or receive ye the remiſſion of ſins, to
wit, by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as is ſhewed <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.3.
<hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. and 5.31. yet according to the nature of the thing
diſcourſed of, it more rightly admits the latter ſenſe; for a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
perſon uſeth not to be requeſted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more powerful into favour.
And thoſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> expreſs the Miniſtry of Reconciliation,
which Reconciliation he had juſt now deſcribed by the Non-imputation of
ſins. So Chriſt himſelf ſaid,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>He was ſent to proclaim
liberty to Captives,</hi> Luke 4.18. and commanded the Apoſtles <hi>to preach
in his name the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Luke 24.47. So <hi>Paul</hi>
himſelf ſaid, <hi>he declared the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins,</hi> Acts
13.38. Eph. 2.16. It is <pb n="169" facs="tcp:106819:89"/>written concerning Chriſt,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that he may reconcile both
Jews and Gentiles in one Body unto God.</hi> This Dative
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But the Interpretation of
<hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that <hi>Deo</hi> here may ſtand by it ſelf, or that
<hi>reconciliare Deo</hi> ſhould be to reconcile them amongſt themſelves,
that they may ſerve God, is wreſted, hard, and without example. Neither is
the Argument, drawn thence, of any force, that in that place <hi>Paul</hi>
treats of the Peace made between the Jews and the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> for it
doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that mention of Peace is unſutable to this Argument, which
is purchaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them both with God; for the two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things that are
joyned, are ſo joyned with one another, that they are firſt and more
eminently joyned to the Bond it ſelf: for they are not joyned with one
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but by and for the Bond. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gentiles and Jews are made
Friends with one another through their Friendſhip with God. And it is
wonderful that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> doth not acknowledge this, when he ſays
himſelf, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20,21,22. <hi>That the Apoſtle having raiſed a
Diſcourſe concerning the Agreement procured between Creatures, 
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106819:90"/>preſently and immediately ſubjoyns mention of that
Reconciliation by which men are made friends to God, and that by the
interpoſition of the word</hi> and, <hi>which uſeth not to joyn things that
have no manner of coherence.</hi> Whence it is manifeſt that theſe things
are joyned with one another: ſo that <hi>Paul,</hi> in that place to the
<hi>Epheſians,</hi> whereof we treat, did rightly refer the Reconciliation of
men with men, unto the Reconciliation of men with God, as an effect to its
Cauſe. That muſt be added, that in that ſame place the blood of Chriſt
is named, as by which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was made. But the Scripture in many
places ſubjoyns <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> to the <hi>blood of
Chriſt,</hi> as its moſt proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28.

Wherefore that is not likely that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> would have, that in this
Sentence on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Reconciliation of. Creatures with one another is mentioned,
but in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sentence the Reconciliation of men with God: for

               </gap>, <hi>and you</hi> ſignifies,
that is, <hi>yea you alſo,</hi> or <hi>you your ſelves.</hi> But in this
Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is not ſaid which <hi>Socinus</hi> ſays, <hi>That
Reconciliation was made by making us unblameable;</hi> but that we were
reconciled, that we might be made unblameable. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> made the way
of the end, verily ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry licentiouſly. The Scripture in many places declares,
that <hi>ſins are forgiven to us, that in time to come we may live holily,
being obliged by ſo great a benefit,</hi> Luke 1.17. And it is to be
obſerved, that in this Sentence alſo there is made mention of <hi>the body
of Chriſt, which was broken for us for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins,</hi> 1
Cor. 11.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. <hi>and of death,</hi> to which likewiſe,
alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before we ſhewed, that remiſſion, as an effect, is attributed.
But that which the Apoſtle adds, <hi>That we were reconciled, when we were
eſtranged and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <pb n="173" facs="tcp:106819:91"/>in our mind,</hi> is like that
which he ſaid elſewhere, <hi>that Chriſt died for us, when we were
ſinners and wicked,</hi> Rom. 5.6,8. and that, <hi>it is God that juſtifies
the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4.5. Wherefore it is ſo much the more juſtly
believed, that here alſo the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is treated of; for this was the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereby the Apoſtle came in to this ſpeech, <hi>that we have in
Chriſt redemption,</hi> to wit, <hi>the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> and
verily it cannot be better underſtood, how much God and Chriſt loved us,
and how much we are Debtors to God and Chriſt, than if we conſider that the
remiſſion of ſins was firſt obtained, and afterwards applied to us,
being under the wrath of God, and guilty of ſins, which two things the
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the moſt part joyns together. But that which <hi>Socinus</hi>
ſaith in another place, <hi>That it behoved God to be throughly appeaſed
towards us, and not angry at all, before Chriſt was ſent to make a
Covenant.</hi> How diſagreeable unto truth this is, he ſeems himſelf
elſewhere to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, when he ſaid, <hi>That at that very
moment, when God offered Conditions to renew Friendſhip with us, he was of a
mind not reconciled, but reconcilable.</hi> And verily Reaſon it ſelf
teacheth this very thing; for <pb n="174" facs="tcp:106819:92"/>in all conditional things
the conditional are before the abſolute. Neither ſhould the Condition only
be offered, but alſo fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, before an abſolute Act followeth.
Wherefore the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We have peace with God, after we are
juſtified by Faith,</hi> Rom. 5.1. Before we are <hi>ſons o wrath,</hi>
Eph. 2.3. for our <hi>ſins are the cauſe of ſepartion,</hi> that is, they
make God averſe from us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.2. This Anger excludes Peace or
Friendſhip; but not any kind of Love generally ſo called, as appears
<hi>John</hi> 3.16. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. And verily <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi>
himſelf ſuppoſeth, <hi>That ſins are not forgiven to men before
repentance.</hi> But he cannot be ſaid to be reconciled, or as
<hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>throughly reconciled,</hi> who yet
imputes ſins. Which thing, that it may be more clearly underſtood, there
are verily three moments, that I may ſo ſay, of Divine Will to be
diſtinguiſhed. The firſt is before the coming to paſs of the Death of
Chriſt, either really, or in the decree and foreknowledge of God. In this
moment God is angry at a ſinner, but ſo as he doth not abhor all ways and
reaſons of laying down his wrath. The ſecond moment is, when Chriſt's
Death is now come to paſs: In which God doth <pb n="175" facs="tcp:106819:92"/>not only
appoint, but alſo promiſe, that he will lay down his wrath. The third is,
when a man believes with a true faith in Chriſt, and Chriſt, according to
the form of the Covenant, commends the Believer to God. Here now God lays down
his anger, and receives a man into favour. But becauſe Verbs Active and
Paſſive anſwering to the ſame, uſe to have a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
ſignification, either that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within Vertue and Efficacy, or
that they include Effect alſo; it follows that in the firſt moment neither
of theſe have place, and therefore in reſpect thereof, God may be called
only reconcileable. In the ſecond and third he is rightly ſaid to be
reconciled, the two Senſes that I mentioned being diſtinguiſhed. In the
former ſenſe God is ſaid <hi>to have reconciled the world to himſelf,
and we reconciled to God, when we were Enemies.</hi> In the latter is that,
<hi>Be ye reconciled to God, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Reconciliation;</hi> and the
ſame is the ſignification of the words <hi>Redemption</hi> and
<hi>Expiation,</hi> and that expreſſion, whereby Chriſt is ſaid
ſometimes <hi>to have died for all,</hi> ſometimes <hi>for ſome.</hi>
Moreover that muſt be obſerved, that the word Reconciliation doth not
exclude Satisfaction, or all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance <pb n="176" facs="tcp:106819:93"/>and Expence. For
in <hi>Livius</hi> there is, <hi>That by that gift he might reconcile unto
himſelf the minds of his Country men:</hi> and elſewhere in many places the
like may be ſeen; ſo that upon that account Chriſt ſhould no leſs be
called <hi>our Reconciler;</hi> which very thing the Scripture alſo ſhews,
when it adds to Reconciliation the mention of Blood.</p>

the ſame; for it is a very frequent thing for ſin to be put for the
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin. And in that place to <hi>Titus</hi> the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being added, that is, <hi>to
expiate,</hi> which we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards explain, and after that in the place
of <hi>Peter,</hi> the mention of a <hi>Lamb,</hi> that is, 
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106819:94"/>a Sacrifice, make this evident; becauſe the Scripture in
many places bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that this Redemption is aſcribed to the Death
of Chriſt as the cauſe, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24.
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Socinus</hi> could not deny it. But how the Death of
Chriſt is the cauſe of Redemption, this is it that is in Controverſie.
For we ſay, <hi>That the Death of Chriſt is therefore the cauſe of
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, becauſe thereby he moved God to deliver us from
puniſhment:</hi> but <hi>Socinus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies this thing. But though there
were ſomething ambiguous in theſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in which mention of
Redemption is made, it would be ſufficient to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the
ſame Argument for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting them, of which ſort we have cited many,
which ſignifie not obſcurely, that Chriſt died for our ſins, ſuffered
pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for us, and ſo obtained us the remiſſion of ſins, to wit,
God being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by his Death; yet we hope that the ſame Opinion may be
proved clearly enough by theſe places which uſe the word Redemption, and
other like it. Now there is a twofold phraſe in Scripture; one which names
the Redemption of ſins, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which names our Redemption by a divers kind
of ſpeaking, but with the ſame ſignification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:106819:94"/>That former phraſe <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15. where
the Death of Chriſt is ſaid to have been cauſed
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> 
               <hi>for the redemption of

               </gap>, and in Latine <hi>culpas,
delicta, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina redimere,</hi> to redeem faults, offences, crimes, there is
not only ſignified the Cauſe moving to deliver, but ſuch alſo as
includes Compenſation or Satisfaction; it is ſo manifeſt, that
<hi>Socinus</hi> ought to have confeſſed that alſo. Therefore ſith this
is the moſt uſual ſignification of that word, it is not allowed us to
recede from it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two things be proved, that ſometimes, though leſs
frequently, another thing is ſignified by that expreſſion, and that there
is here juſt cauſe, why the leſs uſual ſignification ſhould be
preferred before the more uſual. Neither of theſe is proved by
<hi>Socinus.</hi> For he brings no place of Sacred or Profane Writer, where to
redeem tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, ſins, faults, offences, ſignifies any other
thing but that which we ſaid. In the Sentence of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov.
16.6. there is a Hebrew word <hi>Chaphar,</hi> which doth not properly anſwer
the Greek word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: which very thing
<hi>Socinus</hi> alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, when he ſaith, <hi>Expiation</hi> 
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:106819:95"/>rather than <hi>Redemption</hi> is ſignified by that
word. It may be added, that the moſt native ſignification of that word is
to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and thence it is drawn to other things by a certain
reſemblance. Neither doth it follow, becauſe the word <hi>Chaphar,</hi>
which among the Hebrews, as many others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the penury of primitive
words in that tongue, is of many ſignifications, ſo that it may ſignifie
both other things, and alſo <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>to redeem,</hi> that therefore likewiſe the Greek word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhould have all the
ſignifications that <hi>Chaphar</hi> hath, becauſe the uſe of the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is ſimple among the Greeks,
anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own Original; but other words of the Greeks expreſs other
ſignifications of the word <hi>Chaphar.</hi> In <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.24. there is
a Hebrew word <hi>Pharak,</hi> which is not of equal force with the Greek word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but both properly and frequently
it ſignifies <hi>to tear, to break, to pluck up;</hi> and for this alſo
<hi>to deliver.</hi> Howbeit, though we ſhould interpret <hi>redimere</hi> in
this place with the Ancients, nothing compels to take this word out of the
ſignification that we defend: For God is moved by the fruits of repentance to
withold temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as before alſo hath been obſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:106819:95"/>But the other expreſſion, that ſignifies
the perſon redeemed, very often in holy Scripture it is found accommodated to
our Argument; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. and elſewhere. In
Greek there is the verb <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and hence the verbal

               </gap> and

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is asked, <hi>Whether this
act is attributed properly or improperly to Chriſt? Socinus</hi> defines
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per redemption, that is, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
(for otherways the word <hi>redimendi</hi> in Latine is of many
ſignifications) the deliverance of a Captive out of the hands of him that
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him, by giving a price to him that detains him: too narrowly. For both
the nature and uſe of the word is not confined to captivity only, but to
every kind of hurt, as alſo is the word deliverance. Therefore you may more
rightly define <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
<hi>redemptio,</hi> redemption, is the deliverance of a man from an evil by the
interpoſing the payment of a price. So <hi>Maro</hi> uſed the word

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:106819:96"/>
               <hi>Caſtor</hi> is delivered from
perpetual death by the alternal death of his brother being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed: but
improperly <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
<hi>redemptio,</hi> redemption, ſignifies any kind of deliverance; yea, that
alſo which hath no price interpoſed. <hi>But,</hi> as <hi>Socinus</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, and as the Laws teach us, <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of words ſhould
not be receded from, but for weighty cauſes.</hi> Therefore in a doubtful
caſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>redemption</hi>
ſhould be underſtood to be made by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a price. But now
there is no place for doubting, becauſe the Scripture calls him openly

               </gap>, <hi>the price of redemption. For

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a price of redemption for
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Matth. 20.28. Mark 10.45. with which places thoſe are to be
joyned, that bear witneſs that the Redemption was made by Death in Blood, as
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.12. Becauſe theſe places went ſtrongly againſt
<hi>Socinus,</hi> he could invent no other thing but to ſay that
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>pretium,</hi> price, here
is ſaid improperly. And he defines a price properly called, that which is
recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him that detains. Here firſt, that which we ſaid juſt now
muſt be repeated, that property ſhould not be forſaken, unleſs the
matter urge it. But if <hi>Socinus</hi> brought <pb n="183" facs="tcp:106819:96"/>any
Cauſes of deviſing improperty, we truſt they are confuted by us,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 4, 5, 6. for the compariſon made between <hi>Moſes</hi> and
Chriſt ſcarcely needs an anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every ſimilitude hath
certain bounds, beyond which it cannot be ſtretched. They are compared as
deliverers, but in reſpect of the way of delivering, neither doth it more
follow from thence, that Chriſt by ſatisfying hath not delivered us, than
that Chriſt delivered us by the death of Enemies, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi>
did that. What if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon belonged alſo to the way of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
that it might proceed the better, it ſhould be ſaid, that Chriſt
delivered us by Miracles, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> but not by his own Death, or his
own Blood, which neither is aſcribed, nor can be aſcribed to
<hi>Moſes.</hi> But the chiefeſt thing is, that the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>price,</hi> concerning the
force of which we here treat, is added to the deliverance purchaſed by
<hi>Moſes.</hi> For according to the Opinion of <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf,
the way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering is not the ſame; for <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Joſhua</hi> and others, delivered not by doing any thing about the
perſons to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (which <hi>Socinus</hi> attributes to Chriſt) but
by removing them that oppoſed their liberty, to wit, their Enemies;
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="184" facs="tcp:106819:97"/>the property of that word ſhould be retained:
yet the definition of <hi>Socinus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat corrected, that

by which any man is moved, that whereas he was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to do a man hurt, he
ſuffereth him to be delivered from it. That we call a fact or thing
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, herein we diſagree not with

               </gap>h that word agrees both
to bondage, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and death, and every inconvenience, from which
we can be delivered: for both the Original, to wit,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, belongs to thoſe things, and

               </gap> properly called, to be
<hi>received by ſome man.</hi> For if the word <hi>receiving</hi> be taken
rigidly, as it uſeth to be in definitions, it cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to deeds,
but to things only. But Satisfaction may be made, and deliverance obtained by
deeds: and this appears chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in deliverance that is made by the
tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating of puniſhment. For it appears by thoſe things which we
ſaid before, that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment <pb n="185" facs="tcp:106819:97"/>is not properly received
by any man, where we ſhewed, that in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no man is properly and
naturally a Creditor. Moreover, the word <hi>acception</hi> properly taken, if
it doth not ſignifie the tranſlation of property, yet at leaſt ſome
benefit of the receiver. But in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the proper advantage of the
puniſher is not regarded, but the common good and order of things. Therefore
there is here no Receiver, unleſs you pleaſe to call, very improperly, a
Judge a Receiver, as one that takes care of Law and Right and Common Good.

that it is <hi>a price,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.18. But Gold and Silver uſe to be a
price truly, and not figuratively: wherefore it is neceſſary that blood
ſhould be as truly, or alſo much more truly a price. Now a price is that by
the expence whereof ſome thing or right is acquired: and that is the nature
of a price, that by its worth or eſtimation it moves another to grant ſome
thing or priviledge, as impunity. To theſe may be added thoſe places, that
ſhew that Chriſt gave his fleſh or himſelf for the life of the world,
and that he might deliver us, <hi>John</hi> 6.51. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. for this
phraſe to give ſomething for ſomething, is very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to a true

            <p>
               <hi>Socinus</hi> cannot invalidate theſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places,
in which the Death and Blood of Chriſt are called <hi>the price of our
deliverance,</hi> but by ſaying that ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from puniſhment is indeed an effect of the death of
Chriſt (for here is no place of treating of the deliverance <hi>from the
bondage of ſin</hi>) but in reſpect of us, not in reſpect of God, that
is, that God is not thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to deliver us, but we, that we may
come to the deliverance. But both the <pb n="190" facs="tcp:106819:100"/>things that we have
ſaid, and alſo many other things, ſhut up this refuge from him. For
firſt the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and much more
the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are of that nature,
that they ſignifie a thing, the effect whereof is about the deliverer before
the delivered. Moreover, though to buy is taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſimply for to
acquire, as to ſell for to enſlave; but the word <hi>price</hi> being added
to the word <hi>buying</hi> (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. and 7.23.) requires a
nearer ſimilitude. For it moſt proper to a price that it ſhould be
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by any man to be of as great worth as the thing. Moreover, the
Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, is an act that is exerciſed
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the deliverer before the perſon to be delivered. And elſewhere, to
wit, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.12. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, that is,
<hi>expiation:</hi> concerning the force of which word we ſhall afterwards
treat. Add to theſe things, that when an effect is attributed to a thing very
frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo that it was never found attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to other things, (as
the effect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is referred to the Death and Blood of Chriſt,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.45. <hi>Tit.</hi>
2.14. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.9. and 20.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7.) then it <pb n="191" facs="tcp:106819:100"/>is neceſſary that an end
more proper, and near than common and remote, ſhould be underſtood. But
about us, the effect of deliverance is both removed many degrees from the Death
of Chriſt, and alſo ſo far from being proper, that is agrees much more to
other things to which it uſeth not to be aſcribed. For any thing that
<hi>Socinus</hi> ſaith of the connexion of our deliverance with the Death of
Chriſt may be ſummari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained thus: Deliverance (as he thinks) follows
from holineſs of life, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the hope of reward: Hope firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and chiefly proceeds from the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; but it is attributed unto Death,
ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect that it is a way to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and compared with
it, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the ſame hope. Whence it follows (<hi>Socinus</hi> alſo
confeſſing it) that we are much more delivered by the Reſurrection, then
by the Death of Chriſt. Yea, if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth, Death is only
joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that effect by accident; for the Reſurrection makes not Faith,
but as it is a part of the Glory of Chriſt: but the greateſt glory could
have happened to Chriſt, though he had not been dead: But that Chriſt by
ſuffering ſhewed us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that we ſhould follow, that cannot 
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106819:101"/>at all be applied to the remiſſion of ſins, that
happened not to Chriſt. Wherefore then is that ſo often repeated mention of
Death in this buſineſs of Redemption? <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> brings two things;
firſt, becauſe in Death there is ſome Expence, which is not in the
Reſurrection, therefore the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Death is fitter for Redemption:
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe the Love of God and Chriſt is more declared by Death. As
touching the firſt, we go back to the ſame thing; for if by the Death of
Chriſt the effect of our deliverance did not follow of it ſelf (which is
the profeſſion of <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in manifeſt
words) there was no need that Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſhould have
mentioned either Redemption or Price, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſo often: ſith
Deliverance might be expreſſed more conveniently in other words. But that
other conſideration, though it may belong to thoſe Sentences that
commemorate the Love of God, yet is not very ſutably brought to explain other
Sentences which do not, nor yet the very word <hi>Redemption.</hi> It may
alſo here be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that Love is not ſhewed by this thing, becauſe
it was not ſo much the cauſe, as the naked occaſion of our good.
<hi>Socinus</hi> thinks he purſueth our Opinion, when he ſays, 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106819:101"/>
               <hi>That the Scripture ſo treats of the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
purchaſed by the Death of Chriſt, that it ſets ſomething manifeſt
before the eyes, but not that it may declare ſome hidden Vertue, ſuch as he
thinks that to be which we deduce from Scripture.</hi> But when he ſays this,
he wounds not us, but rather furniſhes us with a Dart againſt themſelf.
For thoſe things which are God's, who knows but <hi>the Spirit of God, and he
to whom he will reveal them,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10,11. But that the Death of
Chriſt is procured by God for this purpoſe, that the puniſhment of our
ſins might be required of him, and that he might become our
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid it long
before, Chriſt himſelf ſaid it, neither did the holy Rites in the Old
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſignifie any other thing. So that he who ſhould take notice of
theſe things, could not be ignorant of God's Will and Decree about this
buſineſs: though I may now alſo ſay, that Nature it ſelf ſays, that
<hi>Death is the wages of ſin.</hi> This Will of God being known by Oracles,
there is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards gathered <hi>the great love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us,</hi> as
<hi>John</hi> ſpeaks 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.10. and <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 5.10.
Neither is it any other thing that is ſignified by the word
<hi>witneſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. as it is eaſie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand 
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106819:102"/>by thoſe things that go before, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. And
verily the words of Scripture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſimply underſtood, bring
theſe things with them: whereas it is ſo impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any man to
gather that conſequence of deliverance from Death, which <hi>Socinus</hi>
deduceth through ſo many Degrees, and ſo variouſly, from the words of
Scripture themſelves, that it cannot be eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood out of
<hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf, what he would have to be the proper ſenſe of
Scripture in theſe Expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Therefore true Redemption hath been proved by us, as juſt now true
Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been proved. But either of thoſe being proved, that
which is intended is proved, to wit, <hi>That we are delivered by the
puniſhment of Chriſt, which he paid for our ſins.</hi> Not that all
Redemption and Reconciliation is ſuch, but becauſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter
admits of no other. Therefore it is vain, and nothing to the purpoſe, that
<hi>Socinus</hi> ſo often ſays, both that a man may be appeaſed, though
nothing is performed; and alſo that a man may be truly redeemed that owes
nothing, and therefore without payment. For we treat of that Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and
Redemption, which the Scripture declares to be made by the performance 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106819:102"/>of ſomething, to wit, <hi>by Death,</hi> and of that
Redemption, by which the ſame Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teſtifies, that <hi>we are
delivered from deſerved puniſhment:</hi> but ſuch a perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which
frees the Debtor of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from puniſhment, is both rightly and
properly called Satisfaction; which <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſeeing, that he might
take away Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he took away alſo Propitiation and true
Redemption.</p>
            <p>Here I think good to cenſure ſome other things, which he did not
diſcourſe of whilſt he handled the Argument of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; yet he
diſcourſed of them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, as belonging to this Argument. He would
not have the word <hi>Mediator</hi> to ſignifie any other thing in the holy
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture but the <hi>Interpreter of God.</hi> Two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do perſwade me of
another thing; the one 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. where there is ſaid to be <hi>one
Mediator of God and Men, Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf an
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for all.</hi> The other
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.15. where Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Mediator of the New
Covenant,</hi> that Death intervening for the Redemption of
Tranſgreſſions, <hi>they, that are called, might obtain eternal
life.</hi> To which fitly may be added a third <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.24. which
ſhall be diſcourſed of afterwards: it appears <pb n="196" facs="tcp:106819:103"/>here,
that Mediation is placed in Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf; neither is the word
contrary. For it belongs no leſs to the Office of a Mediator, to be in the
room of Men with God, than to be in the room of God with Men. Neither is a
Mediator only among the unlearned called, <hi>he that appeaſeth a man,</hi>
but alſo amongſt thoſe, who ſpeak elegantly. Whence <hi>Suidas</hi>
interpreted that word <hi>Peace-maker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Elſewhere <hi>Socinus</hi> ſays, <hi>The dignity of the Perſon
makes nothing for the eſtimation of the puniſhment, and conſequently that
the Divine Nature of Chriſt, and his great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, brings no value to
the puniſhment.</hi> But we believe otherways: to wit, that this puniſhment
was thence to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he who ſuffered the puniſhment was God,
though he ſuffered not as God. For hitherto belongs that Expreſſion,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is ſaid to have <hi>purchaſed the Church with his own
Blood,</hi> Acts 20.23. After which manner alſo elſewhere <hi>the Lord of
Glory</hi> is ſaid to have been crucified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. Alſo the
Dignity of the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is, Chriſt, contributes not a little to
this eſtimation: Therefore in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it is called emphatically
<hi>the Blood of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.27. <hi>the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> 
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:106819:103"/>
               <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.14. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt
the Son of God,</hi> 1 John 1.7. both the moſt perfect innocency and
holineſs of Chriſt comes into the ſame eſtimation. Hence it is called
<hi>precious blood,</hi> to wit, <hi>of the Lamb without blame,</hi> 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. making alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the cuſtom, received not only by
the Hebrews, but alſo the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they ſacrificed Beaſts
excellent for white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all beauty of Body, which becauſe they were
exempted from the whole Flock, thence by a word invented in holy things, but
preſently tranſlated to prophane, they were called <hi>eximiae,</hi>
excellent. To the ſame purpoſe belong theſe alſo, <hi>My righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſervant ſhall juſtifie many,</hi> Iſai. 53.11. <hi>He made him that
knew no ſin, to become ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. But that <hi>Socinus</hi>
diſputes, becauſe the Divinity it ſelf doth not ſuffer, therefore that
this comes not into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of puniſhment, it is juſt as if
you ſhould ſay, that it is the ſame thing, whether you ſtrike a private
Perſon or a King, alſo whether you ſtrike an unknown Perſon or a
Father, becauſe ſtrokes are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Body, not to the Dignity of
the Perſon, which groſs Errour long ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath
confuted. Alſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Judgment diſſents from <hi>Socinus.</hi> For 
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106819:104"/>thoſe People, whoſe Laws are moſt praiſed,
eſteemed puniſhments by the dignity of the Perſons and other Attributes.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which are known
evidently to be very full of equity, Puniſhments are varied accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the
Condition of the Perſons; and it hath been abundantly demonſtrated by them,
that did write of Commonwealths, that other Nations, famous for Wiſdom, did
not otherways appoint. And the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Roman</hi> Law prove
it.</p>

received in every Tongue, that when a Perſon did or ſuffered a thing in the
room and place of another, it is ſaid, that he ſuffered, or did that for
him. So it is in <hi>Terentius, I will lead thee, (pro)</hi> inſtead of him;

ambiguous, had not been uſed in theſe places, but it had been openly
ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt died for our good,</hi> by this very thing that
exchange ſhould not have been excluded, but rather inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, other places
being compared. For he alſo who dies for this purpoſe, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may
deliver another from death, dies for his good. Neither can this ſenſe be
rejected, becauſe the fact of Chriſt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <pb n="203" facs="tcp:106819:106"/>to us for example. For unto an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample it is ſufficient that there
be a certain general ſimilitude, though the difference be in a ſpecial
reſpect, of which nevertheleſs mention ſometimes is made for denoting the
thing more certainly. Which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly evident from the Exhortation of
<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. he would have us be <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in
bearing afflictions,</hi> which we ſuffer innocently. He brings the example
of Chriſt, <hi>who,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>himſelf alſo ſuffered.</hi>
This was ſufficient for a compariſon: but he added,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>for us,</hi> which belongs
not the compariſon, but clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the thing it ſelf, that is,
the ſuffering of Chriſt. Therefore Patience is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing; but that
manner is different. Otherways <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould in vain ask, if <hi>Paul
was crucified for believers,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.13. for he alſo could have been
crucified for the Church, that is, for the uſe of the Church, as he ſaid he
<hi>ſuffered for the Church,</hi> Col. 1.24. and afterward he himſelf was
for the great good of the Church behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Peter</hi> and other Apoſtles
crucified. But neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any other man, could be crucified in
that manner that Chriſt was, by ſuffering puniſhment in our ſtead.
Therefore that word <hi>pro</hi> expreſſeth here <pb n="204" facs="tcp:106819:107"/>ſomething peculiar, which cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the
Apoſtles. But it could, if the benefit of Chriſt's death were
diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed only by degree from the death of the Apoſtles, and not
alſo in its proper end. So alſo in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
2.10. there is an example in it, that Chriſt came to glory by Sufferings: the
ſpecial manner is in that, that <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for every man,</hi>
verſ. 9. And as in thoſe places <hi>patience,</hi> ſo in other places
<hi>love</hi> is commended to us by the ſame example of Chriſt, but the
ſpecial manner doth more openly expreſs the deed of Chriſt. Though if you
will look more exactly into thoſe places, we ſhall ſee that not ſo much
the act of death, as the danger of death, is there regarded,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which only <hi>John</hi>

and 38. alſo <hi>John</hi> 15.13. is not properly there to <hi>loſe
life,</hi> but as it were to put it in pledge, that is, to undergo the danger
of death. Therefore in thoſe places, that very thing that is preſcribed to
us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not only the benefit of another, but alſo a certain exchange,
to wit, in that ſenſe, which <hi>Horace</hi> expreſſed in theſe
Verſes:

            <p>But in the ſaying of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> not only as a Propheſy
dropt from him at unawares, but alſo according to his Opinion, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
true ſubſtitution was expreſſed. For he feigned the inevitable
deſtruction of the Jews, if Chriſt ſhould be permitted to live: and on
the contrary, if Chriſt ſhould be ſlain, that certain ſafety ſhould
be obtained for this very thing: Therefore he deſired to ſubſtitute
really the death of Chriſt to a deſtruction otherways hanging over. And
ſo he would have the ſame in kind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall Chriſt with that which was
otherways to happen to the people; and he believed that the death of Chriſt
was a near cauſe of the deliverance of the People, and fit of it ſelf.
Which is the ſame thing as if you ſhould ſay, he would have Chriſt
periſh in the room of the People, that was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (that is, under a
contrary condition) to periſh. Here it muſt be marked by the by, that
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> did put the firſt effect of <pb n="206" facs="tcp:106819:108"/>the death
of Chriſt, not about the Jews, whoſe deliverance he ſought, but about the
<hi>Roman</hi> Governours, whoſe Anger he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to eſcape. So that if
it be true which <hi>Socinus</hi> urgeth, that ſuch an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the
words of <hi>Caiphas</hi> ſhould be taken, which may anſwer both the mind
of the Holy Spirit and his mind, this <hi>dying for the people</hi> muſt
needs ſignifie, that ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was to be obtained from another: but that
other, according to the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, can be none but God: whence
it follows, it is exerciſed about God, before it is exerciſed about men,
which <hi>Socinus</hi> ſtubbornly denies. But thoſe things that have been
hitherto ſaid by us, concerning the ſignification of <hi>exchange</hi> in
the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>pro,</hi> for, are much illuſtrated by the the nature of
the Expiatory Sacrifice. For in thoſe the Scripture and common Opinion of

            <head>CHAP. X. Concerning the Expiation made by the Death of
Chriſt.</head>
            <p>THere remains the laſt rank of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which ſignifie
that Chriſt's Death is an Expiatory Sacrifice: which becauſe by the
Artifice of <hi>Socinus</hi> they are involved in many Miſts, we reſerved
them for the laſt place, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome light from theſe
things that have been ſaid before. We and <hi>Socinus</hi> are agreed
concerning the word: that Chriſt's Death was an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice,</hi>
or a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sin,</hi> the Divine Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
teſtifying the ſame, eſpecially <hi>cap.</hi> 9. But of the proper force
of that word <hi>Socinus</hi> thinks one way, and the Church of Chriſt
another way. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement ſhall be briefly and perſpicuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo
explained, if we ſay, that according to <hi>Socinus</hi> the effect of
expiation firſt and properly is exerciſed about ſins to come; 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106819:109"/>becauſe the Death of Chriſt by ingenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Faith,
draws us from ſins: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of by-paſt ſins only ſecondarily,
and in that reſpect alſo all this action is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about us, not
about God, that is, that God is not moved to pardon, but we are prepared to
receive remiſſion, to wit, by the Amendment of Life: but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the
Opinion of the Church, which agrees to Scripture, the effect of expiation is
properly exerciſed about by paſt ſins, and the firſt action is about
God, who is moved to forgive. That the firſt action is exerciſed about God,
not about Men, it is proved from the nature of Prieſthood. For a Prieſt is
appointed for Men in the things of God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.1. but not for God in
the things of Men, which is the Office of a Prophet. And becauſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
eſpecially Expiatory, Sacrifice, is an act of the Prieſt as ſuch, (for a
High-Prieſt is appointed for this purpoſe, that he may offer Sacrifices for
ſins, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.1. 8.3.) it follows that Sacrifice belongs to thoſe
things, which are performed for Man with God.</p>
            <p>But the whole matter will be made more manifeſt by comparing the
Sacrifices of the Old Law with this Sacrifice, of <pb n="209" facs="tcp:106819:109"/>which
compariſon the Writer of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is an Author
unto us, and elſewhere the Prophets and Apoſtles. The ancient Law is
conſidered two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways: either carnally or ſpiritually. Carnally,
as it was an Inſtrument of the Commonwealth of the Jews. Spiritually, as it
had a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſhadow of things to
come,</hi> Hebr. 10.1. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former conſideration, the Expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sacrifices of the Law ſanctified unto the <hi>purifying of the fleſh,</hi>
Hebr. 9.13. which, of what ſort it is, we ſhall explain. The Law of God had
this ſanction: he is <hi>accurſed that abides not in all the words of the
Law,</hi> Deut. 27.26. Gal. 3.10. therefore he ſhall be guilty of
puniſhment, whoſoever in the leaſt ſhall deviate from the Law, as
<hi>James</hi> ſhews, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. This Puniſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a
carnal ſenſe, was violent death: which is evident from the contrary,
becauſe life is promiſed to him that <hi>fulfils the Law,</hi> Lev. 18.5.
Gal. 3.12. But as in every Commonwealth rightly governed, the King requires
puniſhment by his Judges, and if they fail, by himſelf: So in the Hebrew
Commonwealth, which <hi>Joſephus</hi> rightly called <hi>Theocratia,</hi>
(becauſe God was its King, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.23. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7.) God
ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily <pb n="210" facs="tcp:106819:110"/>required the puniſhments of the Law by
Judges: yet ſo, that he himſelf required the ſame puniſhment, if the
Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es failed in their duty. <hi>Let the people,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſtone
him;</hi> or, <hi>I</hi> ſetting my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry face againſt that man, <hi>will
cut him off,</hi> Lev. 20.3. Neither did he only threaten this, but alſo
often performed it, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by many Examples of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.
But becauſe a Lawyer may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what relax his own Law, eſpecially Penal,
God, the King of the Hebrews, in ſome Crimes admitted Expiatory Sacrifices in
the room of the ſinner himſelf, and by theſe, and no other ways, would he
free the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from the puniſhment of death. He that <hi>ſwore
raſhly</hi> deſerved death by the Law, <hi>Exod</hi> 20.7. but it might be
expiated by a Sacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The Prieſt ſhall make
Atonement for him,</hi> ſaith the Law, <hi>and it ſhall be forgiven
him:</hi> So he that had been <hi>unfaithful in a thing entruſted to
him,</hi> or in <hi>Society,</hi> or had <hi>deceived another,</hi> or had
<hi>ſtollen any thing, he was guilty,</hi> ſaith the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi>
5.23. to wit, by the Edict, which is extant <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.15,16, and 17,
but the ſame guilty perſon, beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the damage, to
which he was obliged, unto the perſon wronged, he was <pb n="211" facs="tcp:106819:110"/>expiated by giving a Sacrifice, and that which he did was forgiven,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 5.26. and in many places theſe are joyned together,
<hi>Expiation</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion, Numb.</hi> 15.28. <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.20.
5.13,18,26. Therefore in ſome Crimes, as touching carnal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
there was admitted an Atonement, a Redemption, a Satisfaction, alſo a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation made by the death of a Beaſt for the death of a man otherways
due. But the Law did not generally admit ſuch a relaxation of carnal
puniſhment in all Crimes: unto which <hi>Paul</hi> having reſpect, ſaid,
<hi>that remiſſion of ſins was declared by Jeſus,</hi> (to wit, a
ſpiritual remiſſion) <hi>and he that believes is juſtified in him,</hi>
from all things from which the Jews in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be
juſtified, no not carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. which an ancient Writer of
<hi>Anſwers to the Orthodox</hi> explains) which uſe to be aſcribed to
<hi>Juſtin.</hi> But other Crimes having been committed to the hurt of the
Commonwealth, (to wit, great and leſs tolerable) or of the life of men, it
gives not (to wit, the Law) an Atonement of ſuch Offences, neither by
waſhing, nor the ſacrificing of Beaſts, but gives a juſt and worthy
recompence to them that offended by an equal puniſhment. <hi>Life,</hi>
ſaith it, <hi>for <pb n="212" facs="tcp:106819:111"/>life, eye for eye, tooth for
tooth:</hi> but where the equality of the reward is unſeemly, there it
renders to the Offenders death by fire, or ſtone, or ſword: for it
deſtroys the daughter of the Prieſt, committing whoredom by fire, but the
daughter of a Lay-man by ſtoning, but the married by ſword. And the Law had
no power, through mercifulneſs to mankind, to ſave any of ſuch by
Waſhings and Sacrifices. And the Maſters of the Hebrews obſerved not
amiſs, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.18. that <hi>David</hi> for Murder or Adultery
promiſed no Sacrifice, becauſe the Law had ſet forth no Expiation for
thoſe Crimes. But that which we ſaid before, that in Expiation the Death of
a Beaſt was ſubſtituted for the death of a Man, that ſame thing is
manifeſt alſo by that which <hi>Deut.</hi> 2. is appointed, that, when the
Man-ſlayer is not fouud, the People ſhould be expiated by the killing of a
Beaſt: where alſo the word. <hi>(to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate)</hi> is explained,
<hi>Expiate thy people, O God, and impute not innocent blood unto them.</hi>
Otherways the Land could not be expiated from blood that was ſhed, but by the
blood of him that ſhed it, as ſaith the Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.34. Unto
this place may be added the other, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. <hi>The life 
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106819:111"/>of all fleſh is in the blood, and I have appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it
for you on the Altar, to make Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for your lives; for it is blood that
makes Atonement for the life.</hi> Alſo a third, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.17. where
the Sacrifice is ſaid <hi>to bear their iniquities,</hi> the force of which
phraſe we have elſewhere explained. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> is not willing to
acknowledge this ſubrogation, or to confeſs that God was moved any way by
Sacrifices, that he might not puniſh ſin. And that he may prove that, he
brings theſe two things; <hi>That the Errours of men could not be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Beaſts, becauſe there is not a common Species between Men and
Beaſts:</hi> and <hi>That nothing can be given to God, who is Lord of
all.</hi> Of which the former is falſe: for as an individual difference, as
they ſpeak, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but another may ſuffer for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans ſin,
provided the inflicting of the evil is not of it ſelf unjuſt, (as hath been
ſhewed before) ſo neither will the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Species hinder a
Beaſt, which otherways alſo might be juſtly killed, to be beſtowed for
an Example, that in the death thereof it may appear what man hath deſerved.
Neither are Man and Beaſt joyned only in the <hi>genus</hi> of a living
Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo in that relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <pb n="214" facs="tcp:106819:112"/>a
poſſeſſour and a thing poſſeſſed. For a Beaſt is in the
general under humane poſſeſſion, and he that was to be expiated, was
particularly commanded <hi>to give a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his own,</hi> Lev. 5.6,7.
But the other is nothing to the purpoſe. For neither doth it follow, that if
nothing comes to God by Sacrifice, therefore God is not moved by Sacrifice. For
by this very thing God is well-pleaſed, that a man defrauds himſelf of a
thing granted unto him for the honour of the Name of God: and it was
elſewhere ſhewed that Satisfaction uſeth to be made as by puniſhment,
ſo by ſome acceptable and pleaſing action. But that in Sacrifice not only
the thing is rewarded, but the mind of the Offerer, both Scripture declares,
and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelves believed. <hi>Neither in Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Seneca, though they be fat and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine Gold, is the honour of
the Gods, but in the pious and right will of the worſhipper.</hi> Whence
alſo the Scripture, treating of the Death of Chriſt, makes mention
ſometimes of <hi>Love,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Obedience.</hi> By theſe
things, which we have ſaid, it is now evident how Sacrifices for ſin in the
Old Covenant did expiate ſins, to wit, by moving God to forgive a Carnal
puniſhment, and that by a certain Satisfaction. But what the Types 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106819:112"/>performed carnally, this Chriſt the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type performs
ſpiritually, and what the Types did in ſome ſins, that Chriſt did in
all, to wit, by moving God to forgive a Spiritual puniſhment, and that by a
moſt perfect Satisfaction. For there is always more, and not leſs, in the
thing ſignified by the Type, than in the Type; as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhews. That is
common to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifice of the Law and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt,
that <hi>there is no remiſſion without ſhedding of blood,</hi> Hebr.
9.22. The Divine Writer in the ſame place calls this obtaining of
remiſſion by blood ſometimes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>Prieſt,</hi> but <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> verſ. 14. and 24. That Legal
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation was a Repreſentation and Antitype of this Celeſtial and
Spiritual. How? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that brought <hi>cleanneſs to the fleſh,</hi>
that is, the taking away of guilt: but not to the Spirit or Conſcience: but
this brings it to the Conſcience it ſelf, becauſe that which was in the
Old Law a Temporal Death, this in the New Covenant is <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death,</hi>
Hebr. 10.29. and therefore there <pb n="216" facs="tcp:106819:113"/>was there a Temporal
Deliverance, but here an <hi>Eternal Redemption,</hi> Hebr. 9.12. Wherefore, as
in the ſame place an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is produced from the effect of the Legal
Sacrifice, to the effect of this. That was offered by the Spirit. <hi>How much
more,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. So it is allowed to us to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue after
this manner moſt certainly: the Legal Sacrifice took away carnal
guiltineſs, by moving God to remiſſion, therefore much more the Sacrifice
offered by the Spirit, takes away ſpiritual guilt, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God alſo to
remiſſion.</p>
            <p>Unto the ſame purpoſe belong thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which Chriſt
is called a <hi>Lamb.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would it be much to the purpoſe, though
Lambs had not been uſed to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in the Law for ſin. For ſo
alſo it would have been lawful for holy men to name one Beaſt for another,
that both the compariſon might conſiſt in the general ſignification of
a Beaſt, and a Lamb rather than a Ram or a Goat, being named, the innocency
of the Sacrifice might be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For therefore alſo <hi>Peter</hi>
added, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame or ſpot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. and at the
ſame time, by a certain compend of words there might have been an eye upon
the Propheſy of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.7. in the intepretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106819:113"/>whereof was the Greek word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.32. But it is
alſo certain, that a Lamb was uſed in the expiating of Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.12. which Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in the Old Law,
ſo nearly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſin, that they alſo received the name of
<hi>ſin.</hi> Whence alſo that <hi>Lamb</hi> in both places is ſaid
<hi>to be offered for guilt</hi> or <hi>ſin.</hi> And in the other place it
is expreſly added, <hi>becauſe he ſinned about the dead body.</hi> The
effect alſo is the ſame in ſome reſpect. For perſons defiled were not
admitted to the Society of the Jewiſh Commonwealth, but by ſuch an
Expiation: Moreover, the Sacrifice of the Paſſover, (which it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
was for the moſt part a Lamb, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.5.) in its firſt
inſtitution, had ſomething Expiatory. For God ſaith, that he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on
the blood thereof, would turn away from the Hebrews that deſtruction, which
otherways they were to have had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Egyptians, (by the imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of whom they had defiled themſelves) <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Hebr.</hi>
11.28. But alſo the Law ſhews that a Lamb was uſed <hi>to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for
ſin,</hi> to wit, the ſin of a <hi>raſh Oath, Lev.</hi> 5.4,6. But when
Chriſt is called a <hi>Lamb,</hi> not only <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews, that a
Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is underſtood, ſaying, that <hi>we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106819:114"/>by the blood of a Lamb,</hi> I <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. but
alſo <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and amongſt
others, where he ſays <hi>he was ſlain,</hi> Rev. 5.6. 9.11. and 13.8. But
no other Sacrifice, but a Sacrifice for ſin, can be underſtood, becauſe
as <hi>Peter</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, it was <hi>Redemptory.</hi> Such is only
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin. Whence it is more than manifeſt, that when the
Baptiſt ſaid, <hi>Chriſt was the Lamb, which took away the ſins of the
World.</hi> John 1.29. Sins paſt are there treated of, not future; and the
taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſins, by the obtaining of remiſſion with God, not by the
ingenerating of Faith. Neither is it true that <hi>Socinus</hi> ſays,
<hi>That only the High-Prieſt did bear the figure of Chriſt, and only the
anniverſary Expiation the figure of his Sacrifice:</hi> for though there was
a more excellent figure in the High-Prieſt, and that ſolemn Sacrifice,
which therefore the Holy Spirit purſues with a ſingular care in the
Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yet it cannot be denied, that other
Prieſts and other Expiatory Sacrifices looked the ſame way more
obſcurely. That ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle ſhews this, <hi>cap.</hi> 9.
<hi>verſ.</hi> 13. where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>carnal purification by Sacrifice,</hi> is
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the <hi>ſpiritual purification by Chriſt.</hi> And much more
<hi>verſe</hi> 21. and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="219" facs="tcp:106819:114"/>
               <hi>verſes,</hi> where, after it had been ſaid in the general,
that almoſt all things in the Law are <hi>purged by Sacrifice,</hi> and that
there is no remiſſion of ſins without <hi>ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood,</hi>
there is afterwards ſubjoyned, therefore there was a neceſſity that the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of Celeſtial things ſhould be purged by theſe things. So
alſo <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. daily Sacrifices are compared
with the Sacrifice of Chriſt: the ſenſe of which place <hi>Socinus</hi>
overthrows, expounding <hi>dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> for <hi>yearly,</hi> without example.
For that he brings a place, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.27. to confirm this
Interpretation, it is vain, becauſe he falſly pretends that the Prieſt
ought to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for himſelf in the Anniverſary Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice only. For
on the contrary, he ought to have offered for himſelf, as oft as he was
conſcious to himſelf of ſin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.3. Alſo he ſhews that
the Sacrifice of the Paſſover was a figure of the Sacrifice that was
performed by Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 19.36. and <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
5.7.</p>
            <p>But though theſe things could ſuffice, yet I think good to
explain ſomewhat more plentifully the natue of an Expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice
according to the common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Heathen, or rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the moſt ancient Tradition, <pb n="220" facs="tcp:106819:115"/>ſpread abroad through
all the Earth. It cannot be doubted, that there were Sacrifices before the Law
of <hi>Moſes</hi> under the ſtate of the Natural Law, as it is called, the
Rites whereof having been commanded by God, thoſe that ſurvived the Flood,
being diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through all the Earth, tranſmitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Poſterity:
and Religion remained for ſome time uncorrupted, not only among the
Poſterity of <hi>Shem,</hi> but alſo <hi>Japhet,</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps alſo
<hi>Ham</hi>) until the worſhip of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and therefore falſe Gods
ſucceeded in its room: but then alſo having changed their God, the Rites
and Ceremonies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, being tranſlated from a pious, to a wicked uſe; a
great teſtimony againſt themſelves of the Truth being received, but
detained in unrighteouſneſs, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.
Therefore thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions eſteemed it for a certain thing, that the Gods
were offended and angry at the ſins of Men: and that from this Anger great
Calamities, partly private, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publick, uſed to follow. See that
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Book of <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

heavily puniſhed by God;</hi> in which, if inſtead of Gods you write God,
you will find many things, worthy to be ſaid <pb n="221" facs="tcp:106819:115"/>by a
Chriſtian. That Anger was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Cauſes or Effects. From Cauſes,
if any wicked Deeds came to be known. From Effects, Foretokens, Prodigies, and
Celeſtial Signs. See <hi>Cicero</hi> concerning the Anſwers of
Soothſayers, <hi>Lucan</hi> 1. of <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia;</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians in many places. Yet they hoped this Anger could
be turned away by certain Sacrifices. By theſe the Deity was ſaid to be
reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the guilty, whether it was one perſon, or a whole people to be
purged, or, according to the ancient word, to be <hi>februated,</hi> and the
ſin it ſelf to be expiated or cleanſed.</p>

And it muſt be obſerved in the firſt place, that when Expiatory
Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are diſcourſed of, there is mention made of Blood, becauſe,

But though, as we ſaid, <hi>piare</hi> properly is here to ſuffer
puniſhment, and therefore is properly ſaid of the guilt it ſelf and debt,
yet it began to be taken for words of a near ſignification, <hi>placare,
luſtrare,</hi> to make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, to purifie by Sacrifice. So
<hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> ſaid, <hi>Cereris numen expiandum.</hi> So <hi>Livius,</hi>
that the manifeſt murther might be expiated by ſome Sacrifice, his Father
was commanded, <hi>ut filium expiaret,</hi> that is, <pb n="228" facs="tcp:106819:119"/>
               <hi>luſtraret,</hi> to purge his Son by Sacrifice, So
<hi>Seneca</hi> in <hi>Troas</hi> ſaid, <hi>piare rates,</hi> that is,
<hi>luſtrare,</hi> to make Atonement for the Ships. Alſo in another Author,
<hi>prodigia piare,</hi> to expiate the Prodigies, for the wickedneſſes for
which the Anger that was raiſed, was declared by Prodigies. There is a place
where the Jews are diſcourſed of by the ſame Author: There happened
Prodigies which the Nation that is ſubject to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and an Enemy
to Religion, judged unlawful to expiate by Vows or Sacrifices. Where by the by
that may be obſerved, we ſaid before, <hi>That the Expiations in the Law of
the Jews, were not ſet forth to expiate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kind of anger of God.</hi> By
theſe things it manifeſtly appears, that purging Sacrifices and Expiations
belonged to the appeaſing of the Deity, and ſo to the obtaining impunity of
the ſins that had been committed: which <hi>Plinius</hi> ſo expreſſeth,
<hi>An ancient Opinion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in former times that all things are Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brua,
whereby the guiltineſſes of evil deeds might be purged, and ſins taken
away.</hi> Neither muſt that remarkable place of <hi>Porphyrius,</hi>
concerning Expiatory Sacrifices be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <hi>for all Divines have agreed in
this; That in Expiatory Sacrifices they ſhould not have touched the things
ſacrificed, and that <pb n="229" facs="tcp:106819:119"/>they ſhould uſe purgings. None
went into the City, or into his own Houſe, unleſs firſt he waſhed his
Garment or Body in a River or Fountain.</hi> That which he ſays the Divines
agreed in, that they ſhould waſh their Garments who touch Expiatory
Sacrifices, it agrees with the Law deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Jews,
as appears <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.26, and 28. But becauſe theſe Nations were not
ignorant by the guidance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the greater the thing was, that was
given to God, ſo much the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily pardon might be obtained;
eſpecially if there were ſome equality of the

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they proceeded from the ſacrificing of Cattel, in making
Expiations to the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of Men. <hi>Caeſar</hi> treating of the
French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, explains the Cauſe: <hi>They think that the Deity of the Immortal
Gods cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, unleſs the life of men be rendered for the life
of man.</hi> The <hi>Canaanites</hi> are found the firſt of all that
practiſed this, that is, the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> For concerning them we
read in holy Scripture, <hi>that they were uſed to reconcile</hi> Moloch
<hi>by killing their own Children.</hi> That <hi>Moloch</hi> was
<hi>Saturn,</hi> as the Maſters of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> rightly explain.
<hi>Porphyrius</hi> tells, <hi>That the Hiſtory of the</hi>

<hi>abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch Narrations.</hi> A part of theſe are
<hi>Tyrians,</hi> amongſt whom it was uſual of old, that a Boy of noble
Birth was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to <hi>Saturn. Curtius</hi> tells, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. the

Inhabitants with the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> received that Sacrifice from the

                  <l>That was their manner to ſacrifice their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their

               </q> The ſame tells <hi>Diodorus</hi> of the
<hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and <hi>Juſtin</hi> in theſe words: <hi>They
ſlew men as Sacrifices, and brought their young Children to the Altars,
requeſting the Gods for Reconciliation with their Blood,</hi> Lib. 18.
<hi>Silius Italicus</hi> ſays, <hi>They were uſed to ask the Gods pardon
with ſlaughter. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> out of <hi>Peſſennius Feſtus</hi>
tells, <hi>That the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>thinking the Gods angry at them,
that they might expiate their Crime, ſacrificed two hundred Sons of the Noble
Men.</hi> Alſo <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> mentioneth it, and
<hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologetick,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That</hi>
Saturnus <hi>was therefore called a Tomb of Sons,</hi> 
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:106819:120"/>and <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Book of <hi>Superstition. Manethos</hi>
did write, <hi>that men, and thoſe of exquiſite beauty, were of old
ſacrificed in</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; and added, <hi>that the cuſtom was kept unto the
times of</hi> Amoſis, <hi>who, inſtead of men, ſubſtituted images of
wax.</hi> And it is reported concerning <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> that it was
diligently ſearched after there, whether they were clean that were appointed
to be ſlain. In <hi>Cyprus</hi> alſo a man was ſacrificed to the time of
King <hi>Diphilis,</hi> who ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſacrificing of an Ox in the
room thereof. The ſame was performed of old in <hi>Rhodes, Chios, Tenedos,
Salamin;</hi> alſo in <hi>Laodicaea;</hi> and among the <hi>Dumathians</hi>
of <hi>Arabia.</hi> The <hi>Perſians</hi> buried men alive in the Earth.
Concerning the <hi>Albans,</hi> this was reported peculiarly, <hi>That the man
whom they thought to be moſt eminent for holineſs, uſed to be
ſacrificed by them.</hi> The <hi>Jonians,</hi> as witneſſeth
<hi>Pauſanias,</hi> ſacrificed a Virgin and a Boy, that they might
reconcile <hi>Diana,</hi> when ſhe was angry. We have read the like things of
the <hi>Blemyans, Maſſagets, Taurians, Neurians,</hi> and in the general of
the <hi>Scythians;</hi> which may be ſufficient for <hi>Aſia</hi> and
<hi>Africa:</hi> To which may be added, that the ſame Rite was found both in
the ancient <hi>India</hi> (concerning which a long <pb n="232" facs="tcp:106819:121"/>time
ſince <hi>Mela</hi> reported the ſame) and in the <hi>American</hi> World
by them that made thoſe parts known to the World. And that alſo it is no
long time ſince that practice was in the <hi>Ganary Iſlands.</hi> That we
may come to <hi>Europe. Ister</hi> and <hi>Apollodorus</hi> have reported.
<hi>That of old in</hi> Creta <hi>Boys were ſacrificed to</hi> Saturn,
<hi>and a Man to</hi> Mars <hi>in</hi> Lacedemon. Moreover, <hi>Phylarchus</hi>
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the ſame manner was among the <hi>Grecians</hi> generally, to
which <hi>Plinius</hi> aſſents. And there are extant Examples alſo in the
times of the <hi>Perſian</hi> war. In <hi>Rome</hi> alſo a <hi>Grecian</hi>
man and a <hi>Grecian</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a <hi>French</hi> man and a <hi>French</hi>

worſhipped with a Humane Sacrifice: and alſo <hi>Diana Aricina:</hi> And
<hi>Plinius</hi> tells, that <hi>ſuch kind of Sacrifices was of old very
uſual in</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Sicily. Neither were they abrogated at

Neither have the Devotions of the <hi>Decians</hi> any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Original, by
which the Ancients, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, in the third Book <hi>de Natura

               </q> In which place, firſt, that uſe of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<hi>pro</hi> is evident, which we before ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be very frequent, and
as it were proper to this Argument, ſo that it is the ſame that <hi>loco
alterius,</hi> in the room of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Moreover it appears, that it was
believed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrifice was
augmented by the dignity of him that was ſacrificed. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, by
comparing Authors, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that theſe things are of like force: 
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106819:122"/>That God is Reconciled by a Sacrifice; that the anger of
the Gods is expiated: or that the Soul of a Man ſufficeth the Gods for the
Souls of others. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>French</hi> men is well known by
<hi>Caeſar's</hi> relation, concerning which we ſpake before: which
<hi>Plinius</hi> ſaith did remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dominion of <hi>Tiberius.

Cicero</hi> ſaid <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care Deos,</hi> to reconcile the Gods, as alſo

               </q> Alſo <hi>Plinius</hi> reported, that in
<hi>Britain</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of this kind were celebrated. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi>
writes, that the ſame was practiſed in the Iſland <hi>Thule</hi> unto his

               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:106819:122"/>hath recorded, that that Cuſtom was not left off before
the Empire of <hi>Adrian.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Maſſilians</hi> it is
particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, <hi>That as oft as the Peſtilence was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,
there was a poor man that uſed to be maintained on publick Charges, whobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
adorned with Ribbonds, and cloathed with holy Garments, was led through the
Town with Curſings, that all the Evils of the City might fall upon him: and
ſo he was ſacrificed to the Immortal Gods.</hi> All which being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together into one, we ſhall ſee that <hi>Plinius,</hi> not without cauſe,
cried out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Sacrifices; <hi>So thoſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with
all the World, though it was at variance and unknown to it ſelf.</hi> Thus we
have diſcourſed by the by concerning Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sacrifices: in which the

alſo becauſe they had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to worſhip God after that manner,
ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> had. But that Cuſtom of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in
Expiating the ſins of Men, or Sacrificing of Beaſts, brings no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
light to the underſtanding of the nature of an Expiatory Sacrifice, and the

had reſpect unto Sacrifices in the general, by which, not only amongſt
the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>but alſo among the Heathen, ſins were believed to be

            <p>Whence it is eaſie to underſtand, what that ſignifies,
<hi>that Christ is called a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin or expiation.</hi> For whereas
<hi>Socinus</hi> brings three Interpretations; the firſt, <hi>That the Death
of Chriſt, by begetting Faith in us, draws us from ſins, in time to
come:</hi> The ſecond. <hi>That Death it ſelf is a certain thing antecedent
to the obtaining remiſſion of ſins:</hi> The third, <hi>That it bears
teſtimony, as it were, to the remiſſion it ſelf, or the Decree made
concerning it.</hi> Of theſe three only the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond belongs hereto: Not
that Chriſt did not alſo thoſe other things, and that much more
effectually than <hi>Socinus</hi> thinks, but becauſe thoſe things belong
not to Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for ſins: for <hi>Socinus</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>That
the ſimilitude of legal Sacrifices for ſin, and of the Sacrifice performed
by Chriſt, conſists in Expiation.</hi> To which may be joyned 
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106819:123"/>the like Sacrifices of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
conſidered not according to the thing, but according to the opinion of the
<hi>Gentiles.</hi> But theſe Sacrifices did not withdraw from ſin,
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by procuring the belief of any thing, neither did they bear
teſtimony to remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on performed, or certainly decreed; but, as
<hi>Socinus</hi> acknowledgeth, they were a certain antecedent thing
requiſite unto remiſſion: which thoſe words of the Law ſhew. <hi>He
ſhall make atonement, and it ſhall be forgiven.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this the
Compariſon conſiſts, and it is neceſſary that Expiation ſhould
ſignifie the ſame when it is applied to legal Sacrifices, and when it is
applied to Chriſt, becauſe the Writer to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> brings both
from the ſame Decree, to wit, <hi>that without ſhedding of Blood there
ſhould be no remiſſion, but expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be made in blood,</hi>
Hebr. 9.21. It hinders not that it is ſaid, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.4. <hi>that it

            <p>But though <hi>Socinus</hi> endeavours to pluck away ſome places
from the true ſenſe, yet being convinced by many others, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,
<hi>That in the Sacrifice of Chriſt it is expreſſed, that an Expiation
was made, which goes before the remiſſion of ſins, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
requiſite.</hi> Yet he denies that God by that Sacrifice is moved to pardon;
but he ſay, <hi>That a certain Faith is begotten in us, by which being
brought to amendment of life, at length we obtain remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
In which, firſt, he did little remember that which he ſaid, <hi>That the
figure ſhould agree with the thing fignified by the figure, in that in which
the Compariſon is made.</hi> Neither did he remember that which the Scripture
ſhews, that thoſe words, <hi>All things are cleanſed by blood,</hi>
belong the ſame way to Legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and to Chriſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi>
9.22. But Legal Sacrifices did not at all beget ſuch a Faith; neither is that
Expoſition of the <pb n="241" facs="tcp:106819:125"/>word tolerable, that <hi>to
expiate</hi> is to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is requiſite for remiſſion. For
on the contrary all theſe words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the like,
which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles uſe, of their own nature, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual uſe,
deſign not only a precedency of order, but alſo a certain efficacy. The
Scripture alſo furniſheth us with other moſt certain Arguments for the
overthrowing this Interpretation invented by <hi>Socinus.</hi> For it ſaith,
there was need of a new <hi>Prieſt after the Order of</hi> Melchiſedec,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.11. But the Levitical Prieſts alſo could preach Faith in
God, yea, and confirm this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their Death. Wherefore, if the
Prieſthood of Chriſt doth nothing more, (which <hi>Socinus</hi> would have)
it follows there was no need of him. Moreover, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, <hi>that
Christ died for our ſins,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved unto ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15.2,3. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Expiation of Chriſt was not chiefly procured for this,
that it might bring a man to believe; ſeeing it ſelf is among things to be
believed. For that which ſerves only to gain credit to a thing, it is
neceſſary that it ſhould be different from the thing to be believed.
Moreover, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the implantation of Faith, the Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt hath
effect in us. For Chriſt <pb n="242" facs="tcp:106819:126"/>is a <hi>High Prieſt
appointed to expiate the ſins of the people,</hi> that is, of Believers,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.17. Therefore <hi>to expiate</hi> cannot be <hi>to bring to
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now that we may not only beat down the falſe Interpretation of
<hi>Socinus,</hi> but alſo prove the true one, which is this, <hi>That God is
moved by the Death of Christ to forgive ſins.</hi> Obſerve that place to
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where <hi>Christ's blood of ſprinkling</hi> is ſaid
<hi>to ſpeak better than the blood of Abel.</hi> The blood of <hi>Abel</hi>
cried unto God for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. The blood of Chriſt cries for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
<hi>Socinus</hi> denies that God is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Expiatory Sacrifices. But
the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above, alledged by us, teſtifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, who uſe the
word <hi>reconciling</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe Sacrifices. Whence alſo that
phraſe came in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſins, that is, to expiate ſins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling God.
<hi>Socinus</hi> acknowledgeth no Satisfaction in Expiatory Sacrifices.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the very word <hi>expiating,</hi> ſignifies no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but
<hi>making ſatisfaction by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and in many places the Authors
ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when they would periphraſtically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Expiating, they call it
<hi>to give blood for blood, life for life, ſoul for ſoul, to purchaſe a 
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106819:126"/>thing with blood, to obtain ſalvation by the death of
another.</hi> Neither do the Hebrew words diſagree from this: for
<hi>Chaphar</hi> is not only <hi>to cover,</hi> but alſo <hi>to redeem,</hi>
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 21.30. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 49.7. and <hi>to appeaſe,</hi> Gen. 32.20. and
thence <hi>to expiate. Hata</hi> is to <hi>ſuffer puniſhment,</hi> Gen.
31.39. whence this alſo began to be uſed for ſignifying Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now
<hi>Expiation</hi> is attributed firſt to <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> as appears
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.13. and 23. therafter to the Prieſt, for the Sacrifices that
he offers, as often in <hi>Leviticus:</hi> and then to God, admitting that
Satisfaction. But as the word <hi>Redeeming</hi> began to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed improperly
for any Deliverance, ſo alſo it began to be called Expiation for the like
effect; yea, where no Satisfaction inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. But
Expiation is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Chriſt, as unto a Sacrifice, and therefore the
word <hi>blood</hi> is added: but blood in Sacrifices, as before was proved, is
given inſtead of the ſoul of a ſinner; whence of neceſſity this word
<hi>Expiation</hi> muſt be taken properly here. Add unto theſe things, that
if that were true which <hi>Socinus</hi> would have, <hi>That Expiation was
made much more by the Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into Heaven, than by
Death and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Blood (becauſe thoſe are fitter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106819:127"/>us to believe than Death it ſelf)</hi> at leaſt, in
ſome place of Scripture <hi>Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> would have been attributed unto
thoſe acts: which it did no where.</p>
            <p>It is falſe that <hi>Socinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> purification is attributed unto
the manifeſtation of the Divine Will:</hi> neither do the places alledged
prove this. For <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to ſuſtain all
by his Word,</hi> becauſe all things are ſubject to his Dominion, as the
word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is found in the ſame

<hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 26, and 29. The knowledge of the Truth, and
ſanctification by Blood, are not put for the ſame, but many Benefits are
joyned together, that the Crime of an unthankful man may appear the more
odious. There is added ſometimes unto Blood the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Covenant, but
much more oftner of a Sacrifice, wherefore that Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be taken,
that may joyn them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But this will be, if we look unto that part of
the Covenant, in which Chriſt engaged, that, <hi>if he underwent death, it
ſhould come to paſs, that their ſins ſhould be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them that
believed in him;</hi> and God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the ſame, as appears
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:106819:127"/>But that Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to offer his
blood in Heaven,</hi> that is, to ſhew his death to his Father, and as it
were to put God in remembrance thereof, which is alſo read <hi>to make
interceſſion for us;</hi> theſe things take not away the Expiation that
was compleated upon the Croſs. For the Expiation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon the Croſs
moves God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and acquires us a right, but under a certain Condition
and Manner, in which is comprehended Interceſſion on Chriſt's part, and
on our part true Faith, as hath been explained when Satisfaction was
diſcourſed of. But <hi>Socinus</hi> manifeſtly contradicts the Scripture,
when he denies <hi>that Expiation was made before Chriſt went into
Heaven.</hi> For in many places Scripture attributes
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, <hi>redemption, purification and

Apoc. 5.6, 12. and 13.8 which <hi>Paul</hi> ſo expreſſeth, <hi>our
Paſſover Chriſt is ſacrificed for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.7. But the
Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over uſed not to be brought <hi>into the most holy place,</hi> Hebr.
9.26. therefore the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice went before, the Appearance followed. So
elſewhere in the ſame Epiſtle, Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to have entred into
the Celeſtial Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by his own blood; having obtained eternal
Redemption,</hi> Hebr. 9.2. <hi>and to have ſat down at the right hand of the
Divine Throne, having made expiation for our ſins.</hi> In which places the
words of by-paſt time do ſhew, that Redemption or Expiation was made before
Chriſt entred into the Celeſtial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. Therefore though Chriſt is
ſuch a High-Prieſt that ought not to have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained on earth,</hi> as
the Levitical Prieſts, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.14. but <hi>having entred into
Heaven,</hi> he ought to be <hi>higher than the Heaven,</hi> Hebr. 4.14. and
7.26. as whoſe Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ought <hi>to be eternal, and
intranſitory,</hi> 7.24. yet he was a true Prieſt, and a true Sacrifice at
that very time, when he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf on Earth up to Death. And
therefore he is ſaid, <hi>to have come into the world,</hi> Hebr. 10.5. (that
is, <hi>into the earth,</hi> as the Scripture if ſelf interprets,
<hi>John</hi> 18. <pb n="248" facs="tcp:106819:129"/>37. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.) that he
might <hi>do the will of God,</hi> verſ. 7, and 9. that he might <hi>offer
his own body, being prepared by God,</hi> that is, <hi>ſacrificed,</hi>
verſ. 6. <hi>to God,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>for ſins,</hi> verſ. 12. In
which place it muſt be alſo obſerved, that we are ſaid <hi>to be

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Oblation
once:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſt intercedes as oft as there is need for us: So that
here not <hi>killing,</hi> but <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> muſt be
underſtood.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Oblation of Chriſt, as of certain Legal Sacrifices,
is twofold. The firſt of <hi>killing,</hi> the other of <hi>ſhewing:</hi>
the former Oblation of Chriſt was performed on Earth, the later in Heaven:
but that former was not a preparation of a Sacrifice, but a Sacrifice: the
later is not ſo much a Sacrifice as a Commemoration of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that was
performed. Wherefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Appearance and Interceſſion are not properly
Sacerdotal Acts, but as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the virtue of the Sacrifice that was
made, he that takes away that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice allows not unto Chriſt a true
Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, againſt the manifeſt Authority of Scripture, which
aſſigns unto Chriſt a Pontifical Dignity, diſtinct from a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and Royal: not figuratively ſo called, but true; for his Prieſthood is
oppoſed to <pb n="249" facs="tcp:106819:129"/>the Levitical Prieſthood, which was a true
Prieſthood, as a more perfect <hi>Species</hi> of the ſame <hi>Genus</hi>
to another leſs perfect: neither could it be rightly inferred, that it was
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Chriſt ſhould have what he might offer, <hi>Hebr.</hi>
8.3. but from the truth of that Prieſthood unto which he was appointed,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 3. But it is no wonder, if they who have taken away from
Chriſt his Natural Glory, that is, the Divinity of his true Name, if they
alſo diminiſh his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and are unwilling to acknowledge his chief
Benefits. <hi>To thee, O Lord Jeſus, as the true God, as the true Redeemer,

ſend from under his power them that he held, but the Devil held us, to whom
we were in bondage by our ſins: Therefore he required our price, the blood of
Chriſt. But until the Blood of Jeſus was given, which was ſo precious,
that it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent alone, for the Redemption of all men, it was
neceſſary that thoſe, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Law, every one for
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould give his own Blood, as it were in imitation of the future
Redemption: and therefore we, for whom the price of the blood of Chriſt was
fulfilled, have no need to offer for our ſelves a price that is the blood of
Circumciſion.</p>

Chriſt imparts this Grace, he gives this gift of his mercy, by ſubduing

there was in the price that was given for him, and in that, which he himſelf
gave for the World: Whereas, he being bought and ſold for a little ſilver,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us at ſo great a price: ſo that it cannot be a doubtful caſe,
that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the price exceeded the bargain. Neither could the
damage, that verily juſt damnation deſerved, be equallized to the Obedience
of Chriſt, which proceeded unto Death it ſelf, and over and above paid what

Member ſuffers, all the other Members ſuffer with it: ſo alſo, when
many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſuffered and ſinned, he alſo ſuffered according to the
ways of ſympathy. For, foraſmuch as it pleaſed God, being the Word, to
take the form of a Servant, and to be joyned to the common Tabernacle of us
all, he takes upon himſelf the pain of the ſuffering Members, and makes our
Diſeaſes his own, and ſuffers grief and pain for us all, according to the
Laws of Love to Mankind. And the Lamb of God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not only performed theſe
things, but having been puniſhed for us, and having <pb n="259" facs="tcp:106819:134"/>endured the ſufferings that he himſelf did not deſerve, but we,

tranſlated unto himſelf, the ſtripes and reproaches and ſhame that was
due to us, and drawn upon himſelf the Curſe that was due to us, becoming a

Goſpel, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. And God had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi>
and his Gifts, but unto <hi>Cain</hi> and his Sacrifice he had no reſpect.
Hence you may underſtand, that he that offered Beaſts was more acceptable
than he that offered a Sacrifice of the Fruits of the Earth. And <hi>Noah</hi>
immediately offered upon the Altar Burnt-offerings of all clean Beaſts, and
of all clean Fowl, and the Lord ſmelled a ſmell of ſweet ſavour: But
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> alſo is recorded to have ſacrificed, ſo that by
teſtimony of ſacred Scripture, thoſe that were lovers of God of old,
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the Sacrifice of Beaſts the chiefeſt <pb n="260" facs="tcp:106819:135"/>of
all. But I ſuppoſe the reaſon of this thing was not accidental, or found
out by man's wit, but taught by the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for ſeeing they ſaw,
that they who in their manners were holy, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with God, and
inlightned in their ſouls by the Divine Spirit, and that they needed to
perform great ſervice for the cleanſing away of the ſins of Mortals, they
ſuppoſed that the price of their Salvation was due to him that is Prince
both of life and ſoul. Moreover, having nothing better, nor more precious to
ſacrifice than their ſoul, inſtead thereof they offered a Sacrifice of
brute Beaſts, bringing them in the room of their own life, thinking that they
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, nor offended in this thing, becauſe they were taught that the
ſoul of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures was not equal to the reaſonable and
intellective faculty of Men, and having been taught that their life is no other
thing but their blood, and the lively power in the blood; which they alſo
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, offering it as a life for a life unto God. And <hi>Moſes</hi>
alſo evidently declares this ſame thing, the life of all fleſh is the
blood thereof, and I have given you the blood upon the Altar to make atonement
for your ſins: for their blood ſhall make <pb n="261" facs="tcp:106819:135"/>atonement
for the life: Therefore I have commanded the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
that no ſoul of you ſhould eat blood: therefore conſider diligently of
theſe things, how it is ſaid, I gave you blood upon the Altar to make
Atonement for your ſouls. For blood ſhall make atonement for the ſoul:
For he doth manifeſtly ſay, that the blood of ſlain Beaſts makes
atonement for the ſoul of man. And the Law concerning Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, gives him
that looks into it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to underſtand this ſame thing. Therefore he
commands every man that ſacrificeth to lay his hands upon the Head of the
thing ſacrificed, and to bring the Beaſt that is to dye to the Prieſt, as
offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrifice inſtead of his own life. Therefore he ſays of every
one, He ſhall preſent it before the Lord, and ſhall put his hands upon
the Head of the Offering; and ſo it was obſerved in every Sacrifice, no
Sacrifice being otherways offered. For which things it is ſaid, that the
Beaſts were brought, that their lives might be offered for theirs.</p>

all ſhould at length be reſtored, for it was due that all men ſhould dye,
as I ſaid before, for which chiefly he came. For this cauſe, after his
manifeſting of his Divinity by his Works, it remained, that he ſhould offer
a Sacrifice for all, having given the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his own Body unto Death for
all men, that he might make all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable and free from the ancient
Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and might declare himſelf alſo to be more powerful
than death, having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own body uncorruptible as a Firſt-fruits of
the Reſurrection of all.</p>
            <p>And preſently: For there was need of Death, and there was need
that Death ſhould be for all; that that which was due <pb n="263" facs="tcp:106819:136"/>from all might be performed: whence as I ſaid before, the Word,
becauſe it was impoſſible that he ſhould dye (for he was Immortal) took
upon himſelf a Body that could dye, that he might offer it, as being his own,
inſtead of all men. And that he ſuffering for all men by entring thereinto,
he might deſtroy him that had the power of Death, that is, the Devil; and
might deliver thoſe that through fear of Death were ſubject to Bondage. The
Saviour of all men having died for us, we that believe in Chriſt, do not now
dye the death as of old, according to the threatning of the Law.</p>
            <p>The ſame in the ſame place. And by ſuch a manner of death
Salvation came to all men, and all the Creation was redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: this is the life
of all. And as a Sheep, he gave his Body unto Death inſtead of all men, for
their Salvation.</p>

But beholding the viſibleneſs of the wickedneſs, and that the Mortal
Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was not able to ſtand againſt Death, nor able to ſuffer the
puniſhment of their ſins, for the exceſſive greatneſs of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
exceeded all puniſhment, and ſeeing the goodneſs of his Father, ſeeing
alſo his <pb n="264" facs="tcp:106819:137"/>own fitneſs and power. For Chriſt is the
power of God, and the wiſdom of God, he was moved with love to Mankind, and
pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying our weakneſs, he cloathed himſelf therewith, for he himſelf, as
ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, took our Infirmities, and carried our Diſeaſes, and
pitying our Mortality, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf therewith; for <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, He humbled himſelf unto death, and that the death of the Croſs;
and ſeeing the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of our bearing the puniſhment, took it
upon himſelf: For Chriſt became a Curſe for us, and ſo being
compaſſed about, and cloathed with Humane Nature by himſelf, brought us
to the Father, that he himſelf ſuffering, may make mans ſuffering to be
without damage, and may exchange ſmall things for great.</p>

fallen down by ſin, and might again reſtore it unto its ancient degree of
Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore the Advantages that have redounded unto us by his Torments,
are very many; for he paid our Debts for us, he bore our ſins, he both

World was redeemed, for he was not a meer man, but the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of
God who died for them. And verily the ſin of one man <hi>Adam</hi> was
effectual to bring death upon the World. But if Death reigned over the World by
the ſin of one man, how much more ſhall life reign by the Righteouſneſs

to ſearch into the Matter and Doctrine, which hath been neglected by many,
but by me hath been very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched after. For unto whom was that
great and much celebrated Blood of God, and the High-Prieſt, and the
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice poured forth, and upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? for we were kept in Bondange
by that wicked one under ſin, and received the pleaſure of Wickedneſs.
But if the price of Redemption belongs to no other but the Poſſeſſour,
I ask to whom was this offered, and for what cauſe? If you ſay that it was
offered to that wicked one; fie upon that Blaſphemy! whereas this thing 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106819:139"/>proceeds from God only. Yea, if it were ſo, a Robber
would receive God for a price of Redemption, and thereby a Reward o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and
above of his Tyranny, for which it was juſt to ſpare us. But if it was
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Father, firſt, how? for we were not kept in Bondage by him.
But what a ſaying is that, that the Blood of the only begotten delights the
Father, who did not accept of <hi>Iſaac</hi> offered by his Father? but he
exchanged the Sacrifice, delivering a Beaſt inſtead of the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sacrifice. Or it is evident that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiveth, not having asked, nor
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been requeſted, but for the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and becauſe of the
neceſſity that man ſhould be ſanctified by the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God,
that he might deliver us, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid hold on the Tyrant by force, and might
bring us to himſelf by his Son, being Mediator, and diſpenſing this for

therefore he redeemed them, whom their own ſins had ſold. But Chriſt was
ſold by undertaking the Condition, not the Fault. And he owes no price for
ſin, becauſe he himſelf did no ſin. Therefore he drew on debt by our

the bodily cleanſing of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament belonged to him: but now there
is a Spiritual cleanſing of the Blood of Chriſt. Therefore he ſaith, This
is the blood of the New Teſtament for the remiſſion of ſins. In thoſe
there was an outſide ſprinkling; <pb n="273" facs="tcp:106819:141"/>and again the
ſprinkled perſon was rinſed: for the People did not always walk
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled with blood. But it is not ſo in the Soul; but the Blood is
mingled with its Eſſence, making that clean Fountain, and bringing forth
unſpeakable beauty. For this cauſe was the killing of the Lamb, and its
blood was ſprinkled on the Door-poſts of them that were to be delivered.
For this cauſe alſo we read of all the Sacrifices of the Old Teſtament,
which were appointed to typifie this Sacrifice; by which comes the true
remiſſion of ſins, and the cleanſing of the Soul for ever.</p>

            <p>In his <hi>Declaration</hi> on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95. Men were held
captive under the Devil, and ſerved Devils; but they were redeemed from
Captivity. For they could ſell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they could not redeem
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Redeemer came, and gave the price, ſhed his blood, and
bought the world. <pb n="278" facs="tcp:106819:144"/>Ask ye what he bought? See what he
gave, and find what he bought. The blood is the price. What is of ſo great
worth? What? but the whole world. What, but all Nations? They are very

it was ſo ſmall a price that it purchaſed only <hi>Africans;</hi> or that

between God and Men, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who condeſcended to undergo
Death for us, that is, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin without ſin. For as he only
was made the Son of Man, that through him we might be made the Sons of God. So
he undertook puniſhment for us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out evil merits, that we throught him

all went aſtray like ſheep, every man wandred in his own way, and God
delivered him up for our ſins. For two Goats are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, not that there are

Hereticks) are the Sons of Perdition and the wicked Seed, which deny the Lord,
that bought them: for we are bought with a price, not corruptible, as Gold and
Silver, but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh

one dying for all pay a ſufficient price for all, if we ſay that was the
ſuffering of any meer man? But if the Word having ſuffered according to the
Fleſh, tranſlated unto himſelf the Sufferings of his own Fleſh, as if
they were his own Sufferings, and claimed them to himſelf, then indeed we do
very well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <pb n="283" facs="tcp:106819:146"/>that the Death of one, according to the

none of his own; for he (ſaith he) doth bear our ſins, and is in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

Bill of wickedneſs not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived! for the eyes of this very body have paid
for the eyes that beheld wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the ears of this body, for the ears that
received pollution; this tongue, likeways, theſe hands, and the other parts,
for thoſe Members that committed any manner of ſin. But the Debt being
paid, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that they who were kept in bondage upon this account,
ſhould be freed from their bondage, and receive their former li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and
return to the Country of their Father.</p>

ſlavery.</p>
            <p>The firſt Inventer of our Miſeries ſtood up arguing the Debt
upon us, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of us Juſtice. Therefore it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that
one of theſe two things ſhould be: that either Death ſhould be brought
upon all according to the Condemnation, becauſe all have ſinned, or that
ſuch a price ſhould <pb n="285" facs="tcp:106819:147"/>be given in recompenſe, that
contained all Righteouſneſs that was required. Now then Man could not
ſave us, for he was liable to the Debt of Sin. An Angel could not redeem the
Human Nature, for the was not capable to pay ſuch a price of Redemption.
Therefore it remained that the ſinleſs God ought to dye for them that had
ſinned; for this only way remained of deliverance from that Evil. What then?
he that brought every Nature out of nothing into being, who was not in
diſtreſs to find out a way of Deliverance, he found out for them that were
Condemned, a moſt ſure Life, and a very honourable way of aboliſhing
Death, and he is born a Man of the Virgin, after ſuch a manner as he
himſelf knows; for ſpeech cannot declare the wonderfulneſs thereof; and
he died in what he became, and purchaſed Redemption by what he was, according
to the ſaying of <hi>Paul,</hi> In whom we have Redemption by his Blood, the

they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a neceſſity of Expiation, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the

that year, he propheſied that Chriſt was to dye for that Nation; and not
for that Nation only, but that he ſhould gather together into one the Sons of
God that are ſcattered, to wit, the Gentiles. Jeſus was ſlain for
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and he offered him for all Mankind, to be an Expiation of

not in that Subſtance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhines with the Father, though it is
ſaid, the Lord of Glory was crucified, but in our Earthly Nature, in which he
took upon him our Earthly Maſs, and was made a Curſe for us, that he might
make us partakers of the Bleſſing that comes from him, and he was content
to ſuffer the Death of Malefactors according to the fleſh, that by
ſuffering Death he might condemn the ſting of Death in his fleſh, and
might deſtroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil.</p>

the Obedience of Chriſt: So alſo after what manner he delivered us from the
ſlavery of the Devil: Now declare how he redeemed us from the Curſe of the
Law, being made a Curſe for us? And after he had ſaid a few words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God in his juſt Judgment required of us all things
that are written in the Law, which becauſe we were not able to pay, therefore
Chriſt our Lord paid thoſe things for us, and willingly took and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unto himſelf the Curſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to which we were liable. And And
he himſelf ſuffered thoſe things that we ought to have ſuffered, being

bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things. And here he aſſerts two things, both that he
cleanſed us from our ſins, and alſo that he did this by himſelf. For by
the Croſs and Death which he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained, he purged us, not only becauſe
he dyed for our ſin, whereas himſelf was free of all ſin, and ſuffered
puniſhment, which yet he did not owe to us, and delivered that Nature that

the Father would not let go the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to us, but was angry at us as Sons
rejecting him, and eſtranged from him. Therefore Chriſt becoming Mediator,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled him unto us. How? what we ſhould have ſuffered (for we ſhould
have <pb n="293" facs="tcp:106819:151"/>dyed) that he ſuffered for us, and made us worthy
of his Teſtament.</p>

juſt God require of them Satisfaction for the ſin they have not? To which I
ſay, God exacteth of no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more than he oweth: But becauſe none can
reſtore as much as he owes, Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rendered more than is due, for all
that are ſaved.</p>

man that owed, and it was a man that paid. For, ſaith he, if one died for
all, them are all dead; to wit, that the Satisfaction of one may be imputed to
all, as he only did bear the ſins of all, and ſo there was not found one
that purchaſed and another that ſatisfied, becauſe one Chriſt is Head
and Body; therefore the Head ſatisfied for the Members, Chriſt for his own
Bowels.</p>
